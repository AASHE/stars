	2.  Install MercurialEclipse (http://cbes.javaforge.com/update)

	5.  Right-click on the project: PyDev > Set as Pydev Project
	6.  Right-click on the project: PyDev > Set as Django Project
	7.  Edit the project's PyDev preferences to use a custom interpreter:
		See README_VENV to create a virutal env that you should use
	7.  Run the tool using "run as Pydev: Django" (this will fail)

Notes:
	If you're getting errors with hg, you might want to check and see which hg
	binary is being used by the ME plugin. Mine was set to:
	/usr/local/bin/hg (version 2.3.1)
	and I had to change it to use the version that had the required plugins:
	/usr/local/share/python/hg (version 2.2.3)
