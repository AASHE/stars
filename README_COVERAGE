# Coverage

## Install the test requirements

    pip install -r requirements_test.txt

## Run the tests with

    coverage run manage.py test submissions

## Limiting coverage

As we fully test more apps, we'll expand the coverage, so, for example, if you
want to add `institutions` to coverage, simply add it to the

    source =
      stars/apps/submissions
      stars/apps/institutions

## Run the report

    coverage report -m

### Note

We can look into an integration with [coveralls.io](http://www.coveralls.io).
