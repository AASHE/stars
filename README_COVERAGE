# Coverage

## Install the test requirements

    pip install -r requirements_test.txt

## Run the tests with

    coverage run run_tests.py

## Limiting coverage

As we fully test more apps, we'll expand the coverage in .coveragerc. So, for
example, if you want to add `institutions` to coverage, simply add it to

    source =
      stars/apps/submissions
      stars/apps/institutions

### Note:

Keep run_tests.py and .coveragerc synced

## Run the report

    coverage report -m

### Note

We can look into an integration with [coveralls.io](http://www.coveralls.io).
