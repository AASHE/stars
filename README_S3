We are using django-s3-folder-storage to handle our media on Amazon's S3

https://github.com/jamstooks/django-s3-folder-storage 

Environment Variables
---------------------

USE_S3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME

Getting Started
---------------

You need to move all the static files from the codebase to the bucket:

> ./manage.py collectstatic

If that doesn't work, check your enivornment variables and ensure you have permission to access the bucket.

The best way to initially populate the uploaded media from another system is to use `s3cmd`. Here's an example:

> s3cmd sync secure s3://<bucket_name>/media/

I did this also for seals and cache.

Note, you need to run s3cmd --configure the first time, to get it set up.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you run into `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` errors, try:

Local Development
-----------------

If you want to work locally, just don't set the `USE_S3` environment variable and set `MEDIA_ROOT` and you'll be good to go.
