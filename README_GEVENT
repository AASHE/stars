Async with Gevent
=================

Getting gevent up and running with gunicorn is a fairly quick process.
Simply add the worker=gevent to gunicorn configuration and monkey-patching
your db library using gunicorn.conf.

Gunicorn
--------

We now have gunicorn.conf in the repo that handles the gunicorn configuration.

The command for starting gunicorn simply needs the -c parameter pointing to this file.

	-c=/path/to/gunicorn.conf

Celery
------

Celery tasks can also run asynchronously:

	celeryd -P gevent
