# Environment

Had to vary the requirements a little to use:

    - `mysql-python`
    - `mysqlclient`
    - new version of `numpy`
    
# Importing latest STARS db:

        $ mysql -u root
        mysql> drop database stars;
        mysql> create database stars;
        $ unzip -p stars.sql.zip | mysql -u root -p stars
        
Note: I had to set `max_allowed_packet=64M` to fix:

        MySQL server has gone away issues.
