STARS has moved from buildout to virtual env and pip. Here's how you set it up:

	1	Using homebrew, be sure to install to the version of python you want to use:
		(right now the production server is running 2.6.5)
	
		`$ brew versions python`
		... run the git checkout command
		`$ brew switch python 2.x.x`
		
	2	Create the virtual environment with the python 2.x.x executable (in this case called, stars-current)
		I like to use virtualenvwrapper, so I only need to create the virtualenv
		once: http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ (see NOTES below)
		
		`$ mkvirtualenv stars-current --no-site-packages --python=/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.x.x/bin/python`
		
	3	Start the virtualenv
		`$ workon stars-current`
		
	4	Pip install requirements
		`pip install -r requirements.txt`
		
	5	Set up your ENV variables in $(WORKON_HOME)/stars-current/bin/preactivate
		See example in notes
	
NOTES:
	I add the following two lines to my .bash_profile:
	
		export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
		source /usr/local/share/python/virtualenvwrapper.sh
	
	By creating stars-current one time, you can use it with any checkout of the code. Of course, if the requirements.txt
	file changes then you will need to either re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or create another venv specifically
	for that branch.
	
	Example preactviate script:
	
		#!/bin/sh
		# This hook is sourced after the virtualenv is activated.

		export STARS_DB_URL="mysql://root@localhost/stars"
		export ISS_DB_URL="mysql://root@localhost/iss"
		export STARS_TEST_DB="sqlite:////Users/jamstooks/sqlite/stars_tests.db"
		export MEDIA_ROOT='/Users/jamstooks/aashe/app_media/stars/'
