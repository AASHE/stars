Welcome to the STARS API's documentation!
=========================================

The STARS API allows remote read and write access to the STARS
reporting system. It has been designed to provide
third-party organizations the opportunity to interact with STARS in an
automated, programmable way. It can also be used by participating
institutions to retrieve their STARS submission data in a
machine-readable format for export or additional processing.
