Welcome to the STARS API's documentation!
=========================================

The STARS API allows remote read and write access to the STARS
reporting system. It has been designed to provide
third-party organizations the opportunity to interact with STARS in an
automated, programmable way. It can also be used by participating
institutions to retrieve their STARS submission data in a
machine-readable format for export or additional processing.

To access STARS information via the API, the appropriate permissions
must be granted on the STARS profile(?). To learn more about STARS
permissions, read the :ref:`stars-access-levels` section.
