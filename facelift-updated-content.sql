The time required to serve as a Technical Advisor will vary based on two main factors:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The volume and nature of the technical questions AASHE receives -- For example, if AASHE receives several credit interpretation requests and technical questions related to the Transportation credits in one month, those Technical Advisors would be called upon more regularly. If no credit interpretation requests or technical questions are raised (which is typical for most subcategories most months), Technical Advisors may not be called upon at all that month.</li>\r\n<li>The phase of the STARS revision cycle -- During periods when AASHE is actively working on preparing new draft credits for public review or testing, Technical Advisors will have more responsibilities than during periods of maintenance.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Technical Advisors generally work to resolve substantive issues as a sub-category group. Depending on the issue in question, Technical Advisors may be asked to provide written suggestions or responses by email or to participate in telephone calls.</p>\r\n<p>The credit revision process begins by consulting with Technical Advisors in that topic area.</p>\r\n<h2>Selection and Terms</h2>\r\n<p>Up to five Technical Advisors per STARS sub-category are selected and appointed by the STARS Steering Committee, based on the criteria outlined above.

Each STARS credit was vetted using the following questions:</em></p>\r\n<p><em>1. Does the credit speak to improved environmental, social, and/or financial impacts?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>2. Is the credit relevant and meaningful for diverse institutions?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>3. If the credit is based on the presence of a strategy, is a performance-based indicator not available or appropriate?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>4. Is the credit measurable, objective, and actionable?</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>STARS credits were developed in large part by reviewing campus sustainability assessments, sustainability reports from businesses, and other sustainability rating and ranking systems. For STARS 1.0 the initial credits from the STARS Pilot were revised or eliminated and new credits were added based on feedback from hundreds of diverse stakeholders and experts. In addition, STARS credits were vetted using four criteria.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>In order to be included, each credit must lead to improved environmental, social, and/or economic performance by colleges and universities. While the sphere of impact may vary each credit should indicate a movement toward sustainability.</li>\r\n<li>Given the diversity of higher education institutions, each STARS credit should be appropriate for most institution types. In order to accommodate this diversity, some STARS credits do not include detailed specifications but are instead flexible or open. In other cases, credits include an applicability criterion, so that the credit only applies to certain types of institutions.</li>\r\n<li>STARS strives to prioritize performance over strategy when possible. Performance credits are based on measurements of sustainability performance while strategy credits focus on approaches or processes that can help improve an institution\'s performance. In many instances, however, measurable, meaningful, and fairly comparable performance indicators could not be identified, so a strategy-based credit was used. As a result, both strategy and performance credits have a place in the system.</li>\r\n<li>AASHE strived to ensure that each credit was objective, measurable, and actionable.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Points were allocated using the following considerations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved environmental impacts?</li>\r\n<li>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved financial impacts?</li>\r\n<li>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved social impacts?</li>\r\n<li>To what extent are there educational benefits associated with the achievement of this credit?                                    \r\n<ul type=\"circle\">\r\n<li>How many people are impacted (breadth)?&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>How deeply are people impacted (depth)?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Tier One and Tier Two Credits</h2>\r\n<div class=\"WordSection1\">\r\n<p>Each STARS credit that meets these four criteria listed above (see also &ldquo;gatekeeper questions&rdquo; textbox) is classified as Tier One or Tier Two.&nbsp; The differences between Tier One and Tier Two credits are outlined below:</p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"height: 0px;\"><strong>Tier One</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"height: 0px;\"><strong>Tier Two</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"height: 0px;\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Strive to capture measurable outcome</li>\r\n<li><span>Vary in the number of points they are worth</span></li>\r\n<li><span><span>Grouped in a subcategory (e.g. Curriculum) within a category (e.g. Education &amp; Research)</span><br /></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"height: 0px;\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Acknowledge strategies and tend to have a smaller impact than Tier One credits</li>\r\n<li><span>Promote strategies whose benefits are already captured by a Tier One credit</span></li>\r\n<li><span><span>Worth 0.25 points each</span><br /></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>',1,'stars-10','<p>STARS 1.0, which launched on January 19, 2010, after a three-year development process.&nbsp; It is the first version of STARS&nbsp;in which Participants could earn a rating.</p>',3993,'2013-08-01 11:39:42'),

Since then, AASHE has worked collaboratively with other non-profits and higher education associations on the development of STARS. A Steering Committee, Strategic Advisory Committee, and a Technical Advisory Committee weighed in on the system and nearly 70 institutions participated in a year-long pilot program.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"social\" target=\"_self\"></a>Why does STARS include &ldquo;social&rdquo; indicators? Isn&rsquo;t sustainability mostly about the environment? </strong><br /> The most commonly used definition of sustainability&ndash;meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&ndash;is from <em>Our Common Future: The Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development</em>, commonly known as the Brundtland Commission report. The interconnectedness and interdependence of the social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainability are included throughout <em>Our Common Future</em>. The Brundtland Commission writes, &ldquo;our inability to promote the common interest in sustainable development is often a product of the relative neglect of economic and social justice.&rdquo; The report continues, &ldquo;[a] world in which poverty and inequity are endemic will always be prone to ecological and other crises. Sustainable development requires meeting the basic needs of all and extending to all the opportunity to satisfy their aspirations for a better life.&rdquo; And, \"[e]ven the narrow notion of physical sustainability implies a concern for social equity between generations, a concern that must logically be extended to equity within each generation.\"</p>\r\n<p>Many popular uses of and references to sustainability also emphasize the concept&rsquo;s economic, environmental, and social dimensions. For example, businesses talk about the triple bottom line: people, planet, and profits (or, alternately, human capital, natural capital, and financial capital). Likewise, sustainability educators commonly refer to the Three Es of sustainability: economy, ecology, and equity. Similarly, popular representations of sustainability underscore the concept&rsquo;s three dimensions. Sustainability experts often use a three-legged stool as a symbol for sustainability. The social, economic, and environmental components of sustainability each represent one of the stool&rsquo;s legs. If one of the legs is missing, the stool cannot balance or function. Another common illustration of sustainability is a diagram depicting three overlapping circles, representing environmental needs, economic needs and social needs. The area where the circles overlap and all three needs are met is the area of sustainability.</p>\r\n<p>STARS represents an attempt to translate this broad and inclusive view of sustainability to measurable objectives at the campus level. Thus, it includes credits related to an institution&rsquo;s environmental, social, and economic performance.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"differences\" target=\"_self\"></a>What are the main differences between the STARS Pilot and STARS 1.0?</strong><br /> First, some credits&ndash;particularly those for which gathering data proved especially difficult or impossible&ndash;have been eliminated.  In addition, STARS 1.0 does not include prerequisites.</p>\r\n<p>Second, additional definitions and guidelines have been added to many credits in an effort to make the credit criteria clearer.</p>\r\n<p>Third, for the first time, AASHE has gone through a deliberate credit weighting or point allocation exercise.  In other words, the point value assigned to each credit has been evaluated relative to other credits such that the credits that have the greatest impact on an institutions&rsquo; sustainability performance are worth the most points.</p>\r\n<p>Fourth, many credits have been restructured such that partial points are available.  This approach better recognizes incremental change and creates a stronger incentive for continued progress toward sustainability.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"how_updated\" target=\"_self\"></a>How will the system be updated?</strong><br /> AASHE will continue to work with STARS participants and the campus sustainability community to improve the system.  Comments or feedback on STARS may be sent to the STARS staff at any time (<a href=\"mailto:stars@aashe.org\" target=\"_self\">stars@aashe.org</a>).  Before a new version (e.g., STARS 2.0) is released, AASHE will hold a public comment period to allow stakeholders an opportunity to comment on proposed changes.

Migrating data will replace any previously saved data and all credits are marked as &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; after migration is complete.&nbsp; Changes to credit status must be done manually.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"migration_options\" target=\"_self\"></a>What is the difference between &lsquo;Version Migration&rsquo; and &lsquo;Data Migration\'?</strong><br /> \'Version Migrations\' allow an institution to migrate between different versions of the STARS Technical Manual.&nbsp; For example, an institution may have registered under a version of STARS, such as 1.1, but during the institution\'s subscription to the STARS Reporting Tool another version of STARS was launched, such as 1.2.&nbsp; Completing a \'Version Migration\' will allow the institution to update credits that are outlined in the \'My Submission\' section of the STARS Reporting Tool so that this information reflects the most current version of the STARS credits. Data saved in the STARS Reporting Tool prior to the migration will be visible in the Reporting Tool once the migration is complete.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Data Migrations&rdquo; allow STARS Participants to migrate previously saved data sets into the STARS Reporting Tool. For example, institutions may choose to pull data from a previously submitted STARS Report, or saved snapshot, into the STARS Reporting Tool. Completing a \'Data Migration\' will allow the institution to work off of the specific data set that is moved into the STARS Reporting Tool instead of documenting data from scratch. Migrating data  will replace any previously saved data.</p>\r\n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:DocumentProperties> <o:Revision>0</o:Revision> <o:TotalTime>0</o:TotalTime> <o:Pages>1</o:Pages>

Participants seeking to migrate data will use the migration function in the STARS Reporting Tool by navigating to the \'My Summary\' page and choosing the \'Migrate\' tab.&nbsp; Please note that it may take a few minutes for a migration to complete, during which time the \'My Submission\' section of the Reporting Tool will be locked. Migrating data will replace any previously saved data and all credits are marked as &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; after migration is complete.&nbsp; Changes to credit status must be done manually.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"sharing_data\" target=\"_self\"></a>How do I share my STARS data with Sierra magazine and The Princeton Review to be considered for their publications?</strong><br /> STARS Participants seeking to share data with other organizations must take a snapshot of the data documented in the STARS Reporting Tool and share this  information. Instructions for  taking and sharing snapshots of data are outlined in  the \"Share Data\"  tab of the \"My Summary\" section in the STARS Reporting  Tool.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"#1.1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a><strong><a name=\"demonstrate\" target=\"_blank\"></a>How can institutions demonstrate that they earn a credit? </strong><br /> There are specific reporting fields that institutions complete to demonstrate that they earn STARS credits.  These reporting fields are outlined in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>. All information is submitted to AASHE through an online <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/tool/\" target=\"_self\">Reporting Tool</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"timeframe\" target=\"_blank\"></a>What timeframe should I use when reporting data for STARS?</strong><br /> Some credits are based on current practices and others are based on historical performance. The <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> includes guidance on what timeframe to use for each credit. For credits that are based on historical data, schools can choose the timeframe for each credit separately; there is no requirement that an institution use the same time period to gather data for all credits. The key requirement for credits that use annual data is that the data are drawn from a consecutive 12-month period.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"letter\" target=\"_blank\"></a>What should the President\'s Letter include and where do I upload it in the STARS Reporting Tool?</strong><br /> Each submittal for a STARS rating must be accompanied by a letter  from the institution\'s president, chancellor, or highest ranking executive that affirms the accuracy  of the institution\'s STARS Submission. In addition, the president or  chancellor\'s letter serves as an introduction or cover letter for the  submission. As such, the letter may also include a description of the  institution\'s commitment to sustainability, background about the  institution, key achievements or highlights from the STARS submission,  and goals for future submissions. Sign-off from the institution\'s  president or chancellor is an important strategy for promoting accuracy  within the STARS self-assessment framework.</p>\r\n<p>When an institution chooses the button to \"Submit for Rating\" in the  STARS Reporting Tool, the institution will be prompted to upload a PDF  version of the letter from the president or chancellor in the second  step of the submission process.

The STARS Administrator will simply view the credit to be updated in the institution&rsquo;s STARS Report on the STARS website and click on the pencil icon next to that credit. The icon will lead the STARS Administrator to the Data Corrections Request Form. &nbsp;Note that the Data Corrections Request form must be accessed through the institution\'s public report, not through the Reporting Tool. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Upon submitting this form, the STARS team will review the form to ensure the submitted information reflects a legitimate correction (as opposed to, for example, an update). Corrections will then be made to the institution&rsquo;s STARS Report. The corrected information in the institution&rsquo;s STARS Report will include a date stamp and note that explains the reason for the change and will be publicly available.

An institution may make corrections to its STARS Report with no charge up to a year after the STARS submission is received by AASHE. After that time, any institution-requested corrections require a  processing fee of $150 per correction. &nbsp;<span>If corrections are in response to a data accuracy inquiry originating from an external party or from an AASHE staff member, no processing fee shall be required.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"logo\" target=\"_blank\"></a>Can I use the STARS logo?</strong><br /> If you are interested in using the STARS logo, please email <a href=\"mailto:stars@aashe.org\" target=\"_self\">stars@aashe.org</a> and explain why you\'re  hoping to use the STARS logo and in what capacity.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"1.1\" target=\"_blank\"></a>Our institution is currently registered for STARS 1.0 or STARS 1.1 and we noticed that a new version of STARS (1.2) has been launched.

Moving forward, AASHE will continue to engage stakeholders in higher education and sustainability, as well as the general public, to seek feedback on the system and ideas for improvements. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Fully transparent methodology</strong>&ndash;The criteria that determine a STARS rating are transparent and accessible to anyone.  This means you can see exactly how each participating institution received its score and what your institution needs to do to improve its score.</li>\r\n<li><strong>High-quality data</strong>&ndash;The <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> provides detailed information about each credit to help ensure data comparability.  Further, the STARS Reporting Tool incorporates controls that limit the possibility of user error.  Moreover, STARS publishes submissions online and requires a &ldquo;responsible party&rdquo; to be associated with every credit.  By contrast, other rating systems gather much of their data through surveys that provide limited supporting information and require little to no supporting documentation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Comprehensive approach</strong>&ndash;STARS awards points for a broader variety of sustainability activity than other rating systems.  Also, consistent with the original and long-standing meaning of sustainability, STARS includes credits related to an institution&rsquo;s social performance, while other systems tend to focus exclusively or primarily on environmental performance.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Absolute scale</strong>&ndash;STARS ratings are based on an absolute scale of progress toward sustainability and are not relative to the performance of other institutions.  There are a couple of benefits to this approach.  First, the scale stays relatively constant over time, thereby providing greater predictability in scoring over time and avoiding the problems associated with &ldquo;moving targets.&rdquo;  Second, the use of an absolute scale better encourages both cooperation among schools and continuous improvement toward sustainability since it keeps the focus on the end goal of sustainability rather than just on being better than other schools.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Community governance</strong>&ndash;STARS is the only campus sustainability rating system that is largely <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/governance/\" target=\"_self\">governed by members of the campus sustainability community</a>.  Additionally, it is the only system with the support and involvement of a <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/governance/3978/\" target=\"_self\">variety of higher education associations</a>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Intended for institutions of all types</strong>&ndash;STARS is intended for all types of higher education institutions, from community colleges to research universities.  Other rating systems were designed for specific types of institutions and often exclude other types.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Only positive ratings</strong>&ndash;STARS provides only positive recognition; there are no bad grades.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Overall, while we respect the role other systems have played in raising the visibility of campus sustainability, we believe that STARS provides a substantially more meaningful assessment of an institution&rsquo;s sustainability performance than other systems available today.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"working\" target=\"_self\"></a>Is AASHE working with the other systems so campuses don\'t have to complete so many surveys? </strong><br /> Yes. Since March 2011, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability  in Higher Education (AASHE), The Princeton Review, Sierra magazine, and  the Sustainable Endowments Institute has been collaborating on an effort  to streamline the reporting process for institutions that choose to  participate in various higher education sustainability assessments. The  intent of this initiative is to streamline the reporting process and  reduce the amount of time campus staff spend completing related surveys.</p>\r\n<p>The result of this collaboration is the creation of the <a href=\"/pages/get-involved/campus-sustainability-data-collector/campus-sustainability-data-collector.html\" target=\"_self\">Campus Sustainability Data Collector</a> hosted by AASHE. The Data Collector is modeled after the STARS Reporting Tool and is  available at no cost.

Institutions that participated in the pilot tested the system and provided feedback to AASHE to help shape future versions of STARS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The STARS pilot project took place in two phases. A phased approach helped to moderate the workload for participating institutions. It also allowed AASHE to solicit another round of feedback about some sections included in STARS before asking schools to gather data.</p>\r\n<p>Phase One of the STARS pilot started in February 2008.

Using a case study research design, I took a multi-disciplinary approach to the data collection for STARS implementation. Through my research I found that STARS is an effective tool to evaluate sustainability at Evergreen, which led to organizational learning, and highlighted Evergreen&rsquo;s complex and dynamic commitment to sustainability.</address>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/documents/STARS/Murphy_STARS_Evergreen.pdf\" target=\"_self\">Thesis presentation</a> (pdf)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/resources/student-research/2009/Murphy_K MESThesis_2009.pdf\" target=\"_self\">Thesis full text</a> (pdf)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong><a name=\"Institutions_Participating_in_the_STARS_Pilot\" target=\"_self\"></a>Institutions Participating in the STARS Pilot</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Institutions are listed below according to their basic Carnegie Classification and student population.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Associate\'s Colleges</strong></h2>\r\n<p><strong>Large (more than 12,500 students)</strong><br /> Cedar Valley College &ndash;

Innovation credits are not required to be specific to any category and are scored separately. Each earned innovation credit increases an institution&rsquo;s overall score by 1 point.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Applicability</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Some credits do not apply to all institutions. For example, the credits about dining services do not apply to institutions that do not have dining services operations. Institutions will earn a score based on the percentage of applicable points they earn. In other words, credits that do not apply to an institution will not be counted against that &nbsp;institution&rsquo;s overall score.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Variability</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In addition, the number of points that are available for a credit may vary based on an institution&rsquo;s context. This variability is linked to third-party reference standards or methodologies for evaluating the sustainability impact of the area being evaluated in the credit. STARS 2.0 introduces this approach to contextual variability in the following&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">credits:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">OP 11: Biodiversity</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">OP 26: Water Use</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Timing</h3>\r\n<p><span><span>A STARS rating is in effect for three years.

For example, credits involving residence halls do not apply to institutions that do not have residence halls.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scoring</strong>&ndash;explains how points are allocated for the credit.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Reporting Fields</strong>&ndash;lists the fields that appear within the Reporting Tool for each credit. Some fields are required while others are listed as optional if the institution wishes to provide additional information.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Timeframe</strong>&ndash;describes the time period from which data should be drawn. For some credits, particularly those that are based on the presence of a policy or program, institutions should report on current practices (i.e. status at the time of reporting). Other credits, particularly those based on quantitative performance, require historical performance data, typically drawn from a one-year period.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sampling and Data Standards</strong>&ndash;provides guidelines on when institutions may use a representative sample to measure performance and when samples are prohibited.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, a <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/get-involved/5053/?root_category=get-involved\" target=\"_self\">step-by-step guide</a> to the details of the entire STARS process, from registration to submission, is also provided within the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/\" target=\"_self\">STARS website</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Institutional Boundary</h2>\r\n<p>Each institution is expected to include its entire main campus when  collecting data. Institutions may choose to include any other land  holdings, facilities, farms, and satellite campuses, as long as the  selected boundary is the same for every credit. Institutions will specify  the boundary for included data in the institutional information section  of the Reporting Tool. If an institution finds it necessary to exclude a  particular unit from its submission, the reason for excluding it must  be provided in the notes accompanying the submitted data.</p>\r\n<h2>Supplemental Data</h2>\r\n<p>STARS Participants reporting under STARS 1.2, or future versions of STARS, will be able to share the information documented for each STARS credit in the STARS Reporting Tool with the Princeton Review and Sierra magazine, if they choose to do so. In addition, there are some data points, not included in STARS, which these organizations are also interested in, that AASHE has identified as supplemental data in the reporting process. Any information documented in the supplemental section does not impact a STARS rating and will not be posted publicly in an institution&rsquo;s STARS Report. Completing these fields is optional but important if your institution would like to be included in Princeton Review Green Rating and/or American&rsquo;s Coolest Schools.</p>\r\n<p>Once your institution has completed documenting its data in the STARS Reporting Tool, it will have the option to allow other organizations to have access to this information for use in their publications. To allow access, STARS Participants much indicate which organization data will be shared with and save a snapshot of data to be shared.&nbsp; Instructions for taking and sharing snapshots of data are outlined in the &ldquo;Share Data&rdquo; tab in the &ldquo;My Summary&rdquo; section of the STARS Reporting Tool. Though all STARS information becomes public, sharing your institution&rsquo;s data in this manner allows these organizations to gain access to the data in a user-friendly manner that is easy to analyze. Please note, the Princeton Review and Sierra magazine may not use all of the data shared.</p>\r\n<p>Your institution must take a snapshot of its data and share this  information to be  considered for another organizations\' publications.

In addition, the institution will be able to see all of the credits in the STARS Reporting Tool that were left blank or marked as \"in progress\" and determine if any last minute changes need to be made to these credits.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Step 2: </em>At this time the institution will upload the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/faqs/reporting-and-information-sharing.html#letter\" target=\"_self\">President\'s Letter</a> which states that all of the information in the STARS submission is accurate and up-to-date.&nbsp; This letter may also serve as a cover letter to the institution\'s STARS Report.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Please note that since acquiring a letter from the president may  take some time, AASHE encourages institutions to begin work with the  president\'s office several months prior to the submission deadline. </strong><strong> </strong>Also, the institution may choose if it would like to submit its STARS data as a <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/faqs/ratings-and-credits.html#levels\" target=\"_self\">STARS Reporter</a> or under the provisional rating it has achieved (STARS Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum).

For example, credits involving residence halls do not apply to institutions that do not have residence halls.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scoring</strong>&ndash;explains how points are allocated for the credit.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Reporting Fields</strong>&ndash;lists the fields that appear within the Reporting Tool for each credit. Some fields are required while others are listed as optional if the institution wishes to provide additional information.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Timeframe</strong>&ndash;describes the time period from which data should be drawn. For some credits, particularly those that are based on the presence of a policy or program, institutions should report on current practices (i.e. status at the time of reporting). Other credits, particularly those based on quantitative performance, require historical performance data, typically drawn from a one-year period.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sampling and Data Standards</strong>&ndash;provides guidelines on when institutions may use a representative sample to measure performance and when samples are prohibited.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/documents/STARS/2.0/stars_2.0_credit_checklist.pdf\" target=\"_self\">STARS 2.0 Credit Checklist</a>&nbsp;(pdf) provides a quick snapshot of the credits included in STARS 2.0. Data collected for each STARS credit is documented in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://stars-facelift.dev.aashe.org/pages/report/stars-reporting-tool.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Reporting Tool</a>, which is only available to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://stars-facelift.dev.aashe.org/pages/celebrate/current-participants.html\" target=\"_self\">current STARS Participants</a>. Current STARS Participants registered under a previous version of STARS may&nbsp;<a href=\"http://stars-facelift.dev.aashe.org/pages/report/data-migration.html\" target=\"_self\">migrate data</a>&nbsp;to the current version.</p>\r\n<h3>Credit Development</h3>\r\n<p>STARS credits were initially developed in large part by reviewing campus sustainability&nbsp;assessments, sustainability reports from businesses, and other sustainability rating and&nbsp;ranking systems. <span><span>The current version of STARS incorporates feedback and suggestions from hundreds of diverse stakeholders and experts. </span></span>For more information see <a href=\"http://stars-facelift.dev.aashe.org/pages/historic-documents.html\" target=\"_self\">previous versions of the STARS Technical Manual</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">Credits vary in the number of points they are worth. Points were allocated by a panel of&nbsp;STARS Steering Committee members and AASHE staff using the following considerations:</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">To what extent does achievement of the credit ensure that people (students,&nbsp;employees and/or local community members) acquire the knowledge, skills, and&nbsp;dispositions to meet sustainability challenges?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">To what extent does achievement of the credit contribute to:</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">a. human and&nbsp;ecological health and mitigate negative environmental impacts?</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">b. secure livelihoods,&nbsp;a sustainable economy and other positive financial impacts?</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">c. social justice,&nbsp;equity, diversity, cooperation, democracy and other positive social impacts?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">3. To what extent are the positive impacts associated with achievement of the credit not&nbsp;captured in other STARS credits?</span></p>\r\n<h3>Impact vs. Difficulty</h3>\r\n<p>As these questions indicate, the focus in allocating points was on the impact, not the difficulty,&nbsp;of earning the credit. Some sustainability initiatives may be very difficult to implement but&nbsp;yield negligible impacts. Conversely, some generally easier projects have significant impacts.&nbsp;Assigning points based on the difficulty of earning a credit would create a perverse incentive&nbsp;for institutions to focus on the difficult projects or initiatives, which may not have the most&nbsp;meaningful impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Given the diversity of higher education institutions, each STARS credit should be appropriate&nbsp;for most institution types. In order to accommodate this diversity, some STARS credits do not&nbsp;include detailed specifications but are instead flexible or open. In other cases, credits include&nbsp;an applicability criterion, so that the credits only apply to certain types of institutions. By&nbsp;following this approach, institutions are not penalized when they do not earn credits that they&nbsp;could not possibly earn due to their circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, STARS is designed to incorporate the full spectrum of sustainability&nbsp;achievement, and upper levels of achievement represent highly ambitious, long-term goals.&nbsp;Therefore there are some credits for which few, if any, institutions will achieve full points currently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, to help ensure that the system works as intended, AASHE strived to ensure that each&nbsp;credit was objective, measurable, and actionable.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>',1,'technical-manual','',NULL,'2013-09-09 12:16:26'),

Since then, AASHE has worked collaboratively with other non-profits and higher education associations on the development of STARS. A Steering Committee, Strategic Advisory Committee, and a Technical Advisory Committee weighed in on the system and nearly 70 institutions participated in a year-long pilot program.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"social\" target=\"_self\"></a>Why does STARS include &ldquo;social&rdquo; indicators? Isn&rsquo;t sustainability mostly about the environment? </strong><br /> The most commonly used definition of sustainability&ndash;meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&ndash;is from <em>Our Common Future: The Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development</em>, commonly known as the Brundtland Commission report. The interconnectedness and interdependence of the social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainability are included throughout <em>Our Common Future</em>. The Brundtland Commission writes, &ldquo;our inability to promote the common interest in sustainable development is often a product of the relative neglect of economic and social justice.&rdquo; The report continues, &ldquo;[a] world in which poverty and inequity are endemic will always be prone to ecological and other crises. Sustainable development requires meeting the basic needs of all and extending to all the opportunity to satisfy their aspirations for a better life.&rdquo; And, \"[e]ven the narrow notion of physical sustainability implies a concern for social equity between generations, a concern that must logically be extended to equity within each generation.\"</p>\r\n<p>Many popular uses of and references to sustainability also emphasize the concept&rsquo;s economic, environmental, and social dimensions. For example, businesses talk about the triple bottom line: people, planet, and profits (or, alternately, human capital, natural capital, and financial capital). Likewise, sustainability educators commonly refer to the Three Es of sustainability: economy, ecology, and equity. Similarly, popular representations of sustainability underscore the concept&rsquo;s three dimensions. Sustainability experts often use a three-legged stool as a symbol for sustainability. The social, economic, and environmental components of sustainability each represent one of the stool&rsquo;s legs. If one of the legs is missing, the stool cannot balance or function. Another common illustration of sustainability is a diagram depicting three overlapping circles, representing environmental needs, economic needs and social needs. The area where the circles overlap and all three needs are met is the area of sustainability.</p>\r\n<p>STARS represents an attempt to translate this broad and inclusive view of sustainability to measurable objectives at the campus level. Thus, it includes credits related to an institution&rsquo;s environmental, social, and economic performance.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"differences\" target=\"_self\"></a>What are the main differences between the STARS Pilot and STARS 1.0?</strong><br /> First, some credits&ndash;particularly those for which gathering data proved especially difficult or impossible&ndash;have been eliminated.  In addition, STARS 1.0 does not include prerequisites.</p>\r\n<p>Second, additional definitions and guidelines have been added to many credits in an effort to make the credit criteria clearer.</p>\r\n<p>Third, for the first time, AASHE has gone through a deliberate credit weighting or point allocation exercise.  In other words, the point value assigned to each credit has been evaluated relative to other credits such that the credits that have the greatest impact on an institutions&rsquo; sustainability performance are worth the most points.</p>\r\n<p>Fourth, many credits have been restructured such that partial points are available.  This approach better recognizes incremental change and creates a stronger incentive for continued progress toward sustainability.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"how_updated\" target=\"_self\"></a>How will the system be updated?</strong><br /> AASHE will continue to work with STARS participants and the campus sustainability community to improve the system.  Comments or feedback on STARS may be sent to the STARS staff at any time (<a href=\"mailto:stars@aashe.org\" target=\"_self\">stars@aashe.org</a>).  Before a new version (e.g., STARS 2.0) is released, AASHE will hold a public comment period to allow stakeholders an opportunity to comment on proposed changes.

	(700,'STARS International Pilot','2011-10-04 12:42:38',71,'<p>Due to growing interest at the international level, the <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/\" target=\"_self\">Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education</a> (AASHE) implemented a pilot program to welcome higher education institutions worldwide to participate in the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org\" target=\"_self\">Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System</a>&trade; (STARS) Program. STARS&reg; was launched by AASHE in January 2010 after several years of research and development by the higher education and sustainability communities in the U.S. and Canada. The <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/documents/STARS/guidelines_for_stars_international_pilot.pdf\" target=\"_self\">STARS International Pilot</a> (pdf) was an opportunity for colleges and universities located outside the U.S. and Canada to participate in STARS and publicly document their efforts related to sustainability. The pilot provided an opportunity for international institutions to share feedback and make suggestions for improvements to the system. The results of the pilot will be used to help determine the eventual role of STARS in a global context.</p>\r\n<p><em>Please note, registration for the STARS International Pilot closed on Dec. 31, 2012. &nbsp;Questions about the program may be emailed to <a href=\"mailto:stars@aashe.org\" target=\"_self\">stars@aashe.org</a>.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of Participating</h2>\r\n<p>STARS will help institutions set and meet sustainability goals and will foster information sharing about practices and performance among the campus sustainability community. All schools that <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/get-involved/registration.html\" target=\"_self\">register</a> for STARS will receive positive recognition as STARS Participants and gain recognition for their sustainability efforts. To further the evolution of STARS, institutions that register for the pilot will be responsible for providing feedback on their experience.</p>\r\n<p>The cost of participating in STARS is $900 for AASHE members and $1400 for non-members. However, eligible institutions were invited to participate in the STARS International Pilot for free. This means that upon registration, such institutions gained access to the online STARS Reporting Tool at no cost and, after going through the data collection process, had their STARS Report published on the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/institutions/rated/\" target=\"_self\">STARS website.</a></p>\r\n<h2>Key Points to Consider&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>The initial intent of STARS was for the system to be used by U.S. and Canadian institutions, therefore there may be some challenges associated with implementing the current version of STARS internationally. Colleges and universities that participated in the STARS International Pilot were eligible to receive the recognition of <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/rating.html#reporter\" target=\"_self\">STARS Reporter</a>, but not the bronze, silver, gold, and platinum rating levels. The benefit of being a STARS Reporter is that institutions are able to select the credits they&rsquo;d like to pursue without having to complete the entire assessment. In addition, STARS Reporters are recognized for publicly reporting their sustainability data, but no scores are made available to the public.</p>\r\n<p>To be eligible to participate in the STARS International Pilot, an institution must have been a higher education college or university based in a country outside of the U.S. or Canada. Participation in the pilot was limited to 50 institutions. Registration closed Dec. 31, 2012. AASHE recommends interested institutions read through the STARS International Pilot <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/documents/STARS/guidelines_for_stars_international_pilot.pdf\" target=\"_self\">guidelines</a> (pdf) carefully.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to registration, AASHE encouraged interested institutions to review the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Credit Checklist and STARS Technical Manual.</a> These documents provide a detailed overview of the STARS process and may illuminate aspects of the system that may be challenging to implement.</p>\r\n<p>View the details regarding the <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/documents/STARS/guidelines_for_stars_international_pilot.pdf\" target=\"_self\">guidelines</a> (pdf) for the STARS International Pilot.

There wasn&rsquo;t enough time to answer the following questions on the air (many questions have been consolidated to avoid redundancy). *Please note the information discussed during this webinar is in reference to STARS 1.0, a previous version of the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Participation Logistics</h2>\r\n<p><strong>What is the expected timeline for completing a STARS assessment?</strong><br /> Each STARS Participant has 12 months from its registration date to complete its data submission.  However, institutions may submit a request for an extension if they are unable to complete their data submission within the 12-month timeframe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How many people typically are involved in the process?</strong><br /> The way institutions gather STARS data is entirely up to the individual institution.  This task can be completed by a professor and his/her class, a master\'s student, through the institution\'s administration, as a Facilities Management project, or by the Sustainability officer--to name a few scenarios.  The process can involve one person to hundreds depending on the model the institution chooses.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are the costs and how are they used?</strong><br /> The registration fee for STARS depends on whether your institution is an AASHE member.  The registration fee for AASHE members is $900 and the registration fee for non-members is $1,400.  Fees are put towards the further development of the STARS program including resources for STARS Participants such as ongoing enhancements to the STARS website and Reporting Tool, as well as workshops and webinars.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Some of my colleagues here are wondering if we submit all our data and don\'t like the rating we get if we can essentially suppress access to our data and the rating altogether until we improve what we do to get the rating we desire.</strong><br /> One of the benefits of STARS is transparency; all data submitted will be made public.  However, there are a couple of things that address this concern:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You&rsquo;ll know your score before completing the submission; a &ldquo;provisional score&rdquo; is displayed throughout the reporting process.</li>\r\n<li>Participation in STARS is entirely voluntary.  You may choose to omit any credits that you choose (though you would not earn points for those credits).</li>\r\n<li>Your institution can choose to submit its data as a STARS Reporter, instead of for a rating, and your score will not be shown with your data.  All institutions may choose Reporter status when finalizing their submissions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>My institution is not yet a member of AASHE.  I would like to try out STARS for 1-2 weeks and see if it&rsquo;s a good fit for us.  If it is, we would consider joining AASHE.  Will you be offering a free trial?</strong><br /> Although AASHE is not offering a free-trial of the program at this time, you may download the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> for free.  The Technical Manual outlines all of the STARS credits and the documentation required for each credit.  You will not have access to the STARS Reporting Tool unless you register to participate, but you can tune in to February&rsquo;s webinar <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/stars-webinars/?root_category=news-events\" target=\"_self\">&ldquo;STARS Reporting Tool 101&rdquo;</a> for a detailed preview of how online reporting for STARS works.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What kinds of recognition can STARS participants receive?</strong><br /> Participants will earn STARS Ratings, which they can use to publicize their sustainability leadership.  AASHE will recognize participants on its website, the STARS annual report, and other publicity.  In addition, AASHE expects that the media and prospective students will use STARS participation as an indicator of sustainability leadership.</p>\r\n<p>Institutions that register before August 20, 2010, will be recognized as STARS Charter Participants.  Charter Participants will be acknowledged as pioneers of STARS and will receive a special logo to use on their websites and print materials.  AASHE will provide additional resources to Charter Participants, including a sample press release.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How  does a university system or community college district participate in STARS?  Do you recommend our colleges join separately or can the system join as one institution?</strong><br /> University systems or community college districts may register for STARS and report as one entity or each institution may register independently.  One registration covers one submission and each system can decide which scale is appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>To determine whether to register as a district or individually, it may be worth looking at <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">the STARS credits</a> and the associated reporting fields.  If most data are gathered centrally, such that it would be difficult to disaggregate information for separate campuses, it may make sense to register as one system.  If most information is tracked at the individual institution level, it may be more appropriate for each college to register independently.   Another consideration is how valuable it would be to benchmark the performance of individual institutions against each other.  If you&rsquo;d like to be able to do this type of comparison, it may be worth registering institutions independently.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the Dallas County Community College District, Eastern Iowa Community College District, and Los Angeles Community College District are participating in STARS as districts instead of individual colleges.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is it too late to become a Charter Participant?</strong><br /> The deadline to become a STARS Charter Participant is August 20, 2010.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I know you and I are concerned with colleges&mdash;but is there a system (or can STARS be edited to be that system) that works for elementary and secondary schools or a single K-12 school site?</strong><br /> STARS participation is limited to colleges and universities (i.e., institutions that are accredited as such and/or confer degrees).  Since STARS was developed specifically for colleges and universities, opening up the system to broader participation would create confusion and strain on the nascent program.</p>\r\n<p>That said, the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> is available on our website and you\'re welcome to use relevant credits or sections of the system to conduct an assessment.  We\'d be happy to answer any questions that arise as you look through the document and apologize that we can\'t make the program available to secondary schools at this time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It was mentioned that a rating will last up to three years.  Can you submit every year for a new rating?</strong><br /> An institution may register for STARS every year, even though the STARS rating is valid for three years.  Each time an institution registers for STARS, a registration fee applies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve been told that once rated that if a school wants to update their data/information that the institution would then have to re-register and pay an additional fee.  Will users who are not using the rating but just listing of the data be able to update information without re-registering? </strong><br /> Each time a campus wants to update its submission, it will need to register and pay a fee. This includes schools that are interested in being a STARS Reporter and those pursuing a rating.  Access to the Reporting Tool, one of the primary benefits of STARS, is tied to the registration fee. Therefore, a campus should be certain that their STARS documentation is accurate when submitting for a rating because changes will not be allowed until a school re-registers and begins the process of submitting for a STARS rating again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>My university has decided that we will not become a STARS participant this year.  Since I do not represent the entire university, only the Associated Students, I&rsquo;m wondering if it is possible for me to submit a partial report for my campus that only speaks to certain sections of the campus which I represent. </strong><br /> As the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">Technical Manual</a> says, participation in STARS is intended for entire colleges and universities.  This may change over time, but at this point, there are a couple key reasons to limit it in that way.  The primary challenge rises from the fact that one of the main advantages of STARS is to allow benchmarking between institutions.  Benchmarking segments of institutions is much trickier.  For instance, AS serves all students but operates only some of the buildings on campus.  As a result, the building energy consumption per student covered by this STARS assessment would be misleadingly low.  Further, another goal of the program is to help foster connections across the university.  By opening STARS up to separate departments, that type of cross-department collaboration is limited.</p>\r\n<h2>STARS Reporting Tool</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Will there be an online reporting tool for STARS like the ACUPCC site? If so, when will it be available?</strong><br /> The STARS Reporting Tool is completely online and is similar to the <a href=\"http://acupcc.aashe.org/\" target=\"_self\">ACUPCC Reporting System</a>.   The Reporting Tool was released on January 19th as part of the STARS 1.0 launch.  STARS Participants can access the Reporting Tool by visiting the STARS website.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can we preview the tool right now? </strong><br /> At this time only STARS Participants may access the Reporting Tool.  However, AASHE will be hosting a webinar called &ldquo;STARS Reporting Tool 101&rdquo; on February 16 that will cover the specifics of how to use the Reporting Tool.  More information will be added to the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/stars-webinars/?root_category=news-events\" target=\"_self\">webinar website</a> as it becomes available.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you go back to different sections as you fill it in and more information becomes available or is it a one-time submission?</strong><br /> Institutions have one year following registration to complete their submissions.  An institution can go back and edit its submission throughout that period.  However, once a submission is finalized, it may not be edited.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How does the tool actually help us track?  Does it actually track waste, water, energy and greenhouse gases? </strong><br /> The STARS Reporting Tool tracks all of the required documentation for each credit listed in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>. This includes information related to waste, water, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions. We encourage you to take a look at the Operations section of the Technical Manual and look through the Reporting Fields that are listed for each credit. This will be the exact information that will be tracked with the online Reporting Tool. In February, there will be an online demonstration of the STARS Reporting Tool to give campuses a better sense of how it works. Stay tuned to our website for more information.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is the tool downloadable (say into Excel or Access) so we don&rsquo;t have 50 people entering information online?  We want to have 1 or 2 people complete the final submission.</strong><br /> The STARS Reporting Tool is not downloadable into Excel or Word.  All information will be entered directly online.  There are a couple options to address your concern within our current structure.</p>\r\n<p><em>Option A </em>-- There are three user levels within the Reporting Tool -- Administrator, Data Entry, and Observers.  Only users with \"Administrator\" privileges are able to complete the final submission.  As an \"Administrator\" you can assign other users \"Data Entry\" status so that they can go in and input data, but you would still be able to verify everything before finishing the submission.  (You can also remove a user\'s Data Entry privileges at any time if you wanted to set aside a period of time in which only one or two users had access to the account.)</p>\r\n<p><em>Option B</em> -- The STARS Technical Manual (available online) lists all of the Reporting Fields associated with each credit -- the list in the Manual is the same as what is in the Reporting Tool.  You can use these lists of reporting fields to inform your data collection process.  I\'m not sure how you\'re planning to approach data collection, but there are a couple of options within this approach.  For instance, you could direct the relevant data gatherers to the Technical Manual, you could copy and paste the lists of reporting fields and distribute them to the relevant parties, or you could follow any number of approaches here.  After you get the responses back from the various data gatherers, you could then input the data into the Reporting Tool yourself (or have one or two others do it).</p>\r\n<p><strong>While completing entries for the credits, are those made public immediately after we save the entry?</strong><br /> When you save your entry for a particular credit, it is not made publicly available immediately.  The submission will be made public only after the entire submission is finalized (and you\'ll be warned and notified in case you accidentally jump the gun on this step).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Does the STARS Reporting Tool provide a platform for data entry and report generation?</strong><br /> The Reporting Tool provides a platform for entering data.  It does not yet generate reports, but that is a feature we\'re working on adding.  <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/help/\" target=\"_self\">Let us know</a> if you have any suggestions for what types of reports would be most useful -- we\'re working on implementing some things already, but welcome suggestions for additional reports and features that would make the tool most useful to participants.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the difference between STARS and Clean Air-Cool Planet\'s Campus Carbon Calculator or </strong><strong>the BC Provincial Government&rsquo;s SMARTTool for mandatory Green House Gas Emission Reduction Reporting?</strong><br /> Greenhouse gas emissions inventorying tools, like the Campus Carbon Calculator, complement STARS.&nbsp; STARS is not a GHG emissions inventory tool -- for the credit based on GHG emissions, users enter their total emissions in terms of CO2 equivalent, not the raw energy or fuel inputs.</p>\r\n<p>STARS includes a couple credits that will be easier to report on and earn as a result of using an inventorying tool (OP Credit 4: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, OP Credit 5: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction, and PAE Credit 5: Climate Plan).  The specific reporting fields associated with each of those credits are outlined in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>.  STARS does not require that a specific GHG emissions calculator or inventory tool be used; the only stipulation is that the inventory adheres to the GHG Protocol\'s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards.  The Campus Carbon Calculator does meet this standard.  I suspect that the SMARTTOOL also meets this standard (it\'s the authoritative standard for this type of tool), but I wasn\'t able to verify that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>STARS Credits</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Will the online score sheet be available to all AASHE members soon? (We&rsquo;d like to work through the process before enrolling in STARS.)</strong><br /> While the STARS Reporting Tool is available only to Participants, all institutions can view the STARS credits now.  The <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> details the credit criteria and the documentation required for each credit.  Since the Reporting Tool includes the same reporting fields that are outlined in the Technical Manual, you can use the Technical Manual to work through the STARS process before enrolling in STARS.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to preview the STARS Reporting Tool, tune into our February Webinar: &ldquo;STARS Reporting Tool 101.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Will STARS be structured to allow for the introduction of completely new strategies in sustainability?</strong><br /> The Innovation category of STARS provides an avenue for institutions to highlight their sustainability efforts that go above and beyond the STARS credits.  More information about Innovation credits is available in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the relationship between STARS and a Campus Sustainability plan?</strong><br /> STARS includes a credit &ndash; PAE Credit 4: Sustainability Plan -- that recognizes institutions that have completed a sustainability plan.  (You may view the criteria for this credit in the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\">STARS 1.0 Technical Manual</a>.)  STARS also provides a valuable framework for institutions looking to develop sustainability plans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do students, staff, faculty, and administrators fit into the categories that you have outlined (e.g., operations, education &amp; research, etc.)?</strong><br /> STARS credits are organized into categories that are meant to cover the functional areas of colleges and universities, not campus stakeholder groups.  As a result, these campus groups don&rsquo;t separate perfectly into the STARS categories.  Indeed, one of the goals of STARS is to facilitate sustainability work that transcends these groupings.</p>\r\n<p>While no perfect groupings exist, faculty and students may find the Education &amp; Research category especially relevant.  Administrators may find credits in the Planning, Administration &amp; Engagement category particularly relevant.  Staff members may be drawn to any of the three categories, depending on their areas of focus (e.g., a facilities staff member would find the Operations credit most relevant while a community service coordinator would find the PAE category most relevant).</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Credit Checklist</a>, which provides a quick snapshot of the STARS credits, may provide a useful guide for understanding how various groups can contribute to each of the STARS categories.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How different are the early release technical manual and the current STARS January release?</strong><br /> No major changes were made between the STARS 1.0 Technical Manual and the Early Release edition. The <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/documents/STARS/Technical_Manual_Changes.pdf\" target=\"_self\">Record of Changes</a> (pdf) details the differences between the documents.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I am working on a disposal policy fort campus materials&mdash;everything from desks and landscape materials to construction waste&mdash;where does a policy like this fit into STARS?</strong><br /> The Operations category of STARS includes a Waste sub-category.  You can view the credits and their required documentation in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The development of a disposal policy could contribute to the achievement of several of the STARS credits concerning waste.  A disposal policy could contribute to the reduction of waste on campus, the waste diversion, recycling of campus materials, as well as the management of hazardous waste--all of which are addressed in the STARS credits on waste.</p>\r\n<p>I encourage you to read the Waste sub-category in the Operations category of STARS and use STARS as a guide while developing your disposal policy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What professional roles and benchmark standards are recommended for residence education within college/university\'s department of Housing and Residence Life?</strong><br /> Housing and residence life departments play an important role in advancing campus sustainability and can contribute to achieving several STARS credits.  The Co-Curricular Education sub-category, which focuses on student learning outside of the classroom, may be of particular interest.  The Co-Curricular Education subcategory includes the following credits (you can find full details about these credits in the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\"><em>STARS 1.0 Technical Manual</em></a>): ER Credit 1: Student Sustainability Educators Program, ER Credit 2: Student Sustainability Outreach Campaign, ER Credit 3: Sustainability in New Student Orientation, ER Credit 4: Sustainability Outreach and Publications, Tier Two 1: Student Group, Tier Two 2: Organic Garden, Tier Two 3: Model Dorm Room, Tier Two 4: Themed Housing, Tier Two 5: Sustainable Enterprise, Tier Two 6: Sustainability Events, Tier Two 7: Outdoors Program, Tier Two 8: Themed Semester or Year.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the Co-Curricular Education subcategory, residence life departments contribute to many other STARS credits as well.  For instance, credits in the Diversity and Affordability subcategory about student training in diversity issues may be achieved through residence life\'s program offerings.  Likewise, residence life\'s energy conservation, waste reduction, water conservation, and other operational initiatives can help institutions earn points in the Operations category.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Given that one of the goals of the STARS assessment is to provide criteria which work for most institutions, will there be a mechanism for individual colleges to make arguments for re-weighting their credits if the \"local perspective\"  does not necessarily match with the current weighting?</strong><br /> At this time, the weighting of STARS credits is consistent for all institutions; there isn\'t an option for institutions to re-assign different point values to the credits.</p>\r\n<p>You\'re certainly right that there isn\'t a perfect or one-size-fits-all approach to allocating points or determining which credits have the largest impacts. As with all aspects of STARS, we do hope to improve the point allocation methodology for future versions of the system.  One potential approach that we\'ve discussed is to follow LEED\'s model and accommodate regional variation by assigning certain credits regional priority points.  We\'ve discussed following the same strategy based on institution types as well (such that credits that are more important for community colleges are assigned additional points for those institutions, for example).  We hadn\'t previously considered opening it up to the individual institutions and letting them assign additional points or re-weight any of the credits, but that\'s an interesting idea.   One potential challenge with this approach would be making sure these additional points don\'t just become freebies.  It\'s easy to imagine an institution allocating these points to practices they have already implemented in order to increase its overall score, instead of adding points to the practices or outcomes that are the most impactful or meaningful given its context.  We\'d welcome additional suggestions or comments on how this may work or other ways to improve the point allocation methodology -- please send any suggestions to stars@aashe.org.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Speak about the credits weight as impact on the environment.</strong><br /> The <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\"><em>STARS 1.0 Technical Manual</em></a> describes how points were allocated. The relevant section (it\'s found on page 4 of the document) is copied below.</p>\r\n<p><em>While each Tier Two credit is worth 0.25 points, Tier One credits vary in the number of points they are worth.  Points were allocated using the following considerations:  <br /> </em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved environmental impacts?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved financial impacts?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved social impacts?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>To what extent are there educational benefits associated with the achievement of this credit?</em> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>How many people are impacted (breadth)? </em></li>\r\n<li><em>How deeply are people impacted (depth)?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>As these questions indicate, the focus in allocating points was on the impact, not the difficulty, of earning the credit.  Some sustainability initiatives may be very difficult to implement but yield negligible impacts.  Conversely, some generally easier projects have significant impacts.  Assigning points based on the difficulty of earning a credit would create a perverse incentive for institutions to focus on the difficult projects or initiatives, which may not be the most meaningful or impactful. </em></p>\r\n<p><em>While AASHE has strived for a fair and consistent approach to allocating points, this is an inherently subjective exercise.  Developing a more robust point allocation methodology &ndash; including finding stronger ways to accommodate how regional variations and difference in institution type influence each institution&rsquo;s sustainability impacts &ndash; will be considered for future versions of STARS. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the difference between Tier One credits and Tier Two credits?&nbsp; </strong><br /> The description of Tier One vs. Tier Two credits from the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\"><em>STARS&nbsp;1.0 Technical Manual</em></a> (found on pages 3-4 of the document) is copied below:</p>\r\n<p><em>Each STARS credit that meets these four criteria is assigned a type: Tier One or Tier Two.  <br /> </em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Tier One credits &ndash; Tier One credits are worth one or more points each and are grouped in a subcategory (e.g., Curriculum) within a category (e.g., Education &amp; Research)</em></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Tier Two credits &ndash; Many of the subcategories in STARS include Tier Two credits, each of which is worth 0.25 points.  There are two reasons a credit is classified as Tier Two instead of Tier One. </em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Some Tier Two credits recognize strategies that merit recognition, but tend to have a smaller impact than Tier One credits.  For example, there is a Tier Two credit for institutions that have a bike-sharing program.  Having a bike-sharing program warrants recognition, but has a smaller impact on a campus&rsquo; impact than having significant numbers of students and employees use environmentally preferable modes for commuting, which are captured in Tier One credits. </em></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Other Tier Two credits promote strategies whose benefits are already largely captured by a Tier One credit.  For example, one Tier Two credit recognizes institutions that have a composting program.  While composting is an important sustainability strategy, the primary benefits of composting are captured by a Tier One credit on waste diversion. </em></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>STARS Reporter Status</h2>\r\n<p><strong>If you are a STARS Reporter is the information made public as well?</strong><br /> All institution data that are submitted through the STARS Reporting Tool will be made publicly available.  This applies to those institutions that submit their data as STARS Reporters or for a STARS rating.  Since STARS is a self-assessment framework, making the submissions public is a key strategy to ensure accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike institutions that earn a STARS rating, STARS Reporters will not have a score displayed with their submissions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I\'m wondering about the option to report as a STARS Reporter, without applying for a rating. Would we still require sign off from the president/chancellor? </strong><br /> Each institution that completes its STARS submission is required to submit a letter of affirmation from its highest executive (president or chancellor).  The letter from the institution&rsquo;s president or chancellor is an important strategy to help ensure that all information submitted is accurate.  Thus, the letter is required both for STARS Reporters and institutions that are pursuing a rating.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can a university sign up for Reporter status and switch to assessment when we gain confidence?</strong><br /> When your institution registers as a STARS Participant you do not have to indicate if you would like to be a STARS Reporter or pursue a rating.  As you document your data in the STARS Reporting Tool you will be able to see your provisional rating, which is based on points received from the completed credits, throughout the entire data documentation process.  Once you are ready to submit your institution\'s completed dataset, you can then indicate whether you would like to be identified as a STARS Reporter or by the STARS rating you have earned.</p>\r\n<h2>Relationships with Other Assessments</h2>\r\n<p><strong>What is the status of collaboration with other surveying groups such as SEI, Princeton Review, and Sierra Magazine? Are there any specific partnerships in the works?</strong><br /> AASHE is open to collaborating with any organization that can help us further our mission, including those that offer ratings or rankings for higher education. One of the main goals of STARS is to address survey fatigue and eliminate redundancy to more effectively meet the needs of the campus sustainability community. We have the support of our <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/governance/3978/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\">Founding Partners</a> and will be welcoming additional Partner Organizations this year. Information on AASHE partnerships related to STARS will be noted on our website.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is AASHE actively communicating with other organizations that have surveys to make them aware of what will be included in STARS?</strong><br /> AASHE hopes that the public data submitted through STARS will serve as the go-to place for information related to a college or university&rsquo;s sustainability performance. One of the goals of STARS is to reduce survey fatigue that many campus sustainability staff experience.  We will be encouraging other organizations with ratings, rankings, or surveys, to use the information submitted to the STARS Reporting Tool. Though we have not actively pursued this type of collaboration yet, it will be a part of our outreach efforts moving forward.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How does STARS interact/collaborate with the College Sustainability Report Card, if at all?</strong><br /> STARS is a program of AASHE and is separate from the Green Report Card (as well as other ratings and rankings) but we have collaborated with the Sustainable Endowments Institute (who puts out the Report Card) in the past and hope to again in the future. We will be encouraging anyone, including other organizations with ratings, rankings, or surveys, to use information that is submitted through the STARS Reporting Tool in the hopes of reducing the survey fatigue that many campus sustainability staff experience.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If I understand, STARS is a comprehensive environmental management system (EMS) that was designed to assist institutions with sustainability transformation initiatives.  Understandably different than ranking systems, where institutions compete for a specific ranking, how else is STARS aligned to better suit 21st Century sustainability initiatives in the United States and Canada, when compared to EMS systems, such as, the International Standardization Organization\'s system (ISO) 14000/ISO19011?</strong><br /> Both ISO 14000 or 19011 and STARS can serve as valuable tools for campuses.  There are a couple key differences between these EMS\' and STARS.  In addition to the differences between rating systems and management systems, which you mentioned, there are two major differences worth highlighting:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>STARS was developed by and for higher education.  As such, it includes credits unique to higher education, like curriculum and research.  Likewise, the credits in other areas, such as investment or operations, are informed by a higher education perspective.</li>\r\n<li>STARS is a sustainability system (rather than strictly environmental), and consistent with the long-standing definition of sustainability, includes indicators related to institutions\' social, environmental, and economic performance.  An EMS focuses on environmental pieces.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Have you geared STARS to any other global Sustainability system such as Global Reporting Initiative?</strong><br /> AASHE consulted several other sustainability reporting and assessment frameworks, including GRI, when developing the STARS credits.  STARS and GRI are similar in several ways.  Both systems are consistent with the long-standing definition of sustainability and include social, economic, and environmental considerations.  Likewise, both systems emphasize transparency in reporting (all data that institutions submit for a STARS rating will be made publicly available).  Since GRI and STARS have these similarities, GRI was an excellent source when brainstorming STARS credits and we try to stay up-to-speed with their activities and learn from their good work.</p>\r\n<p>That said, there are some key differences between the systems too.  First, STARS was developed by and for colleges and universities, so it covers topics specific to higher education like curriculum and research, which GRI does not include.  Similarly, GRI is not a rating system; it\'s a reporting framework.  While STARS works as a reporting framework, it is also a rating system.  In this way, STARS is organized into a series of credits, whereas GRI is organized as a series of reporting fields.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How does STARS compare/fit in with LEED?  How is it different? </strong><br /> There are several similarities between STARS and LEED:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Structure </strong>-- Both systems are based on a checklist of credits organized into different categories.  Likewise, both systems have Innovation credits to recognize new and innovative practices that aren\'t captured by the checklist.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Levels of Recognition</strong> -- Both systems include multiple levels of recognition (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) to signify progressively higher achievement.  (STARS includes an additional recognition level (STARS Reporter) for institutions that aren\'t pursuing a rating but are still demonstrating leadership by participating in the system.)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Positive Recognition</strong> -- Both systems offer only positive recognition.  Just as all levels of LEED certification signify green building leadership, all of the STARS levels are positive indications of campus sustainability leadership.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are a couple key differences between STARS and LEED:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Audience </strong>-- A LEED certification pertains to one building.  A STARS rating covers an entire college or university.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scope </strong>-- Since LEED certification is specific to buildings, LEED credits are generally focused on the specific features and aspects of the building.  Since STARS covers an entire institution, the credits cover a broader range of activities.  For example, STARS covers an institution\'s curriculum, research, purchasing, human resources, transportation, and other activities.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Certification vs. Assessment</strong> -- LEED is a certification that is verified by a third-party.  STARS is a self-assessment framework that incorporates a couple different strategies to ensure that the reported information is accurate.  First, all data reported to earn a STARS Rating are made publicly available.  Second, each credit must be accompanied by an affirmation from a responsible party attesting to the accuracy of the information submitted (the responsible party\'s name will accompany the public submission).  Third, each submission must be accompanied by a letter from the institution\'s highest executive (President or Chancellor) affirming the accuracy of the entire submission.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Because LEED focuses specifically on buildings and STARS looks at entire campuses, we see the rating systems as very complementary.  Indeed, STARS recognizes green buildings as a key component of campus sustainability and that LEED is the leading green building standard in the US and Canada.  As such, STARS includes two credits (OP Credit 1: Building Operations and Maintenance and OP Credit 2: Building Design and Construction) that award points for having LEED certified campus buildings.  (Additional details about these credits are available in the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\"><em>STARS 1.0 Technical Manual</em></a>.)  We are excited that the U.S. Green Building Council (the organization that developed and administers LEED) was involved in the STARS development process and is a <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/governance/3978/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\">STARS Founding Partner</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>AASHE Membership</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Do you have to be a member of AASHE to use the STARS program?</strong><br /> No, you do not have to be an AASHE member to participate in the STARS program.  All colleges and universities in the United States and Canada are welcome to participate.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The registration fee for non-member institutions is $1,400.</li>\r\n<li>The registration fee for AASHE&nbsp;member institutions is $900.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your institution may consider becoming a member of AASHE to take advantage of the member rate when registering for STARS.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Does the AASHE membership fee cover STARS registration? </strong><br /> The STARS registration fee is separate from the AASHE membership fee.  AASHE members received a discount on STARS registration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why can\'t individuals join AASHE?</strong><br /> AASHE membership focuses on colleges and universities.  The <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/membership/Institutional_Membership.php\" target=\"_self\">description of institutional membership in AASHE</a> explains the advantages of a full campus membership, rather than individual memberships: <br /> <em>An institutional membership connects your campus with leading edge colleges, universities and organizations working toward a sustainable world.  Membership covers every individual at your institution - so the entire campus can take advantage of AASHE member benefits. This type of membership is virtually unique among higher education associations, but necessary since all sectors of campus must work collaboratively and learn from each other in advancing sustainability.  Join the AASHE community today!</em></p>\r\n<p>If individual faculty members, students, staff or administrators were to join, it would be harder to get the commitment of the entire institution and to work across sectors, which is necessary for campus sustainability work.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to college and university memberships, AASHE offers an array of business memberships, which we refer to as the Business Alliance program.  Dues for participation in the Business Alliance vary based on the size of the company and level of benefits.  <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/about/business.php\" target=\"_self\">More information about the Business Alliance program is available online</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Other</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Can a vendor/supplier of sustainability products apply for STARS Certification for Universities to apply towards their STARS Rating?</strong><br /> STARS is a self-assessment for colleges and universities. Participating schools receive a rating. It is not a certification system and STARS does not endorse products. However, products with certain attributes or products that deliver a specific outcome may contribute to campuses earning credits in STARS. I encourage you to check out the STARS Credit Checklist for an overview of the credits and review the details included in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> for more specific information including credit criteria.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our university will register for STARS this year and plans to hire a third party consultant to help with the effort. Do you have any advice for working with these types of consultants?  How does one go about identifying local qualified consultants who can assist universities in conducting a STARs assessment?</strong><br /> Since STARS has just launched, we don&rsquo;t yet have a sense of the experiences of those campuses that have worked with consultants on their data collection process. We welcome participating schools to post ideas and feedback to AASHE\'s <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/forums\" target=\"_self\">Campus Sustainability Discussion Forums</a>, a great resource for STARS Participants. In time, AASHE will offer suggestions and perhaps even guidelines for how campuses can best accomplish their STARS assessment internally or through a third party consultant. At this point, we would encourage campuses to be sure that the consultant is familiar with the STARS Technical Manual and the credit requirements. It would also be good to make sure a consultant is familiar with the process of using the STARS Reporting Tool. There will be a webinar in February that will provide an online demonstration of how the Reporting Tool works.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Will there be more training available for faculty to infuse sustainability into the curriculum (in addition to AASHE\'s workshops)? </strong><br /> In addition to the <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/profdev/curriculum.php\" target=\"_self\">Sustainability Across the Curriculum Leadership Workshops</a>, AASHE&rsquo;s annual conference includes sessions and workshops on sustainability curriculum.  <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/conf2010\" target=\"_self\"><em>AASHE 2010</em></a>, our next conference, will take place in Denver, Colorado, from October 10 to 12. <a href=\"http://www2.aashe.org/conf2008/\" target=\"_self\"> Archives from the 2008 conference</a> are available online.</p>\r\n<p>Additional training opportunities will be announced in the <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/publications/bulletin.php\" target=\"_self\"><em>AASHE Bulletin</em></a>, our free, weekly newsletter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Knowing the urgency to address climate change immediately; knowing the extent of change required in reducing the energy intensity of our energy use, food production and diet, building operations, transportation and waste generation patterns and habits; is it not necessary for Higher Ed to shift to draconian measures such as banning cars on campus, reducing meat offerings for dining services, going to a paperless communications system, etc. immediately?  Is it reasonable to think we can take 20 years of collegial dialogue and discussion to move this agenda?</strong><br /> AASHE certainly recognizes the importance and immediacy of the challenges we are facing today. We think STARS will be a powerful tool in addressing sustainability challenges, especially since STARS recognizes outcomes and focuses on performance. STARS provides guidelines for embracing sustainability but also allows flexibility for campuses to decide the best approach. To learn more about these approaches or get other perspectives, we encourage you to start a conversation using AASHE&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/forums\" target=\"_self\">Campus Sustainability Discussion Forums</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Are there templates available for a letter to send to departments and administrators about STARS?</strong><br /> We don\'t have template letters yet, but this is a great suggestion and we\'ll work on developing them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Does STARS have a Life Cycle Analysis tool for materials used on Campuses?</strong><br /> STARS does not have a lifecycle analysis tool for materials used on campus.  I suspect many institutions would benefit from such an instrument, but it\'s beyond the scope of the program at this time.  You may wish to post this question to AASHE\'s <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/forums\" target=\"_self\">Campus Sustainability Discussion Forums</a> to see if others have resources to recommend.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Chris O&rsquo;Brien mentioned incorporating sustainability initiatives into the American University campus grounds department. Could you give us a brief overview of what is being done?</strong><br /> From Chris O&rsquo;Brien: We are about to become a pilot campus for <a href=\"http://www.sustainablesites.org\" target=\"_self\">Sustainable Sites</a>. This is sustainable grounds-keeping program builds on LEED but goes much deeper in the area of grounds. They are still seeking pilot campuses, so I encourage you to considering applying.</p>\r\n<p><strong>As the recently appointed Director of Sustainability at American University, how have you (the position) been received by the campus community? </strong><br /> From Chris O&rsquo;Brien: My role at AU has been received with open arms by everyone I encounter on campus. I have approached people all across the campus community to introduce them to STARS and request their participation in the credits relevant to their function. In most cases, I have found that people are doing sustainability activities already which weren&rsquo;t centrally planned or organized. In a number of cases, when I have asked people to do specific sustainability activities, they have responded with: &ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s great. I have suggested this in the past, so I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re asking me to do it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In short, there has been latent sustainability energy lying just under the surface all over our campus. Tasking an office and an individual with planning, implementing and tracking sustainability has made all the difference in turning that latent energy into real activities. People feel that their sustainability efforts are now part of a bigger picture. Because they see how their efforts are contributing to a shared goal, they can also share in the success once we achieve our STARS rating.</p>',0,'2010-stars-webinars','',NULL,'2013-08-01 09:20:09'),

	(100,'Sharing Data Overview','2012-01-31 11:18:44',75,'<p>Since March 2011, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), The Princeton Review, Sierra magazine, and the Sustainable Endowments Institute has been collaborating on an effort to streamline the reporting process for institutions that choose to participate in various higher education sustainability assessments. The  intent of this initiative is to streamline the reporting process and  reduce the amount of time campus staff spend completing related surveys.</p>\r\n<p>To address this issue, The Princeton Review, Sierra magazine, and the Sustainable Endowments Institute have worked with AASHE to establish the Campus Sustainability Data Collector as the source for information needed to complete their publications (The Princeton Review Green Rating, Sierra magazine&rsquo;s Cool Schools issue, and the Sustainable Endowment Institute&rsquo;s College Sustainability Report Card, respectively.&nbsp; Please note, the Sustainable Endowments Institute has <a href=\"http://greenreportcard.org/media\" target=\"_self\">suspended</a> the production of the College Sustainability Report Card and will no longer be seeking data for this publication). In addition, there are some data points, not included in STARS, which these organizations are also interested in, that AASHE has identified as supplemental data in the reporting process. This will allow institutions that want to participate in the various programs to complete the information needed by each organization and enable the organizations to collect this information without having to send out individual surveys to institutions.</p>\r\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\r\n<p>STARS Participants reporting under the most current version of the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> will be able to share the information documented for each STARS credit in the STARS Reporting Tool with The Princeton Review and/or Sierra magazine if they choose to do so. Institutions that are not STARS Participants will also have an opportunity to streamline the reporting process for data requested by these organizations by using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/get-involved/campus-sustainability-data-collector/campus-sustainability-data-collector.html#institutions_not_participating\" target=\"_self\">Campus Sustainability Data Collector</a>.&nbsp; However, the process will be a bit different for institutions that are not participating in STARS.</p>\r\n<p>Please note, the Sustainable Endowments Institute has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://greenreportcard.org/media\" target=\"_self\">suspended</a>&nbsp;the production of the College Sustainability Report Card and will no longer be seeking data for this publication.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>For STARS Participants</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Princeton Review and Sierra magazine are seeking data from specific STARS credits to be considered in their evaluation of institutional sustainability efforts for their publications.&nbsp; In addition, Sierra magazine is seeking one supplemental data field (SD 10). Any information documented in the supplemental section does not impact a STARS rating and will not be posted publicly in an institution&rsquo;s STARS Report. Completing these fields is optional but important if your institution would like to be considered for inclusion in Sierra magazine\'s Cool Schools issue. Please note, the Sustainable Endowments Institute has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://greenreportcard.org/media\" target=\"_self\">suspended</a>&nbsp;the production of the College Sustainability Report Card and will no longer be seeking data for this publication.</p>\r\n<p>To share data through the STARS Reporting Tool with either The Princeton Review or Sierra magazine, institutions will take a &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; of the data marked as &lsquo;pursuing&rsquo; in the Reporting Tool.&nbsp; Instructions for how to successfully take and share a snapshot of data are outlined in the &ldquo;Share Data&rdquo; tab of the &ldquo;My Summary&rdquo; page in the Reporting Tool.&nbsp; Each institution has the ability to share its data with the organizations of their choosing. Though all STARS data submitted for a STARS Report is public, STARS Participants may share data with organizations outside of AASHE without submitting a STARS Report. Sharing your institution&rsquo;s data through the &lsquo;Share Data&rsquo; tab in the STARS Reporting Tool allows organizations to gain access to the data in a user-friendly manner that is easy to analyze. Please note, The Princeton Review and Sierra magazine each have a different target audience and therefore may not include data from all institutions in their various publications.</p>\r\n<p>Institutions will need to be working in the most up-to-date version of the STARS Technical Manual in order to share data.&nbsp; Institutions that wish to migrate their data to the latest version of STARS may do so by choosing the &ldquo;Migrate&rdquo; tab in the &ldquo;My Summary&rdquo; page of the STARS Reporting Tool.&nbsp; Please note, migrating data may take some time so please be patient.&nbsp; Also, once the migration is complete, each credit will be marked as &ldquo;In Progress.&rdquo; Only credits marked as &ldquo;Pursing&rdquo; will be captured in a snapshot of data to be shared with other organizations. Changing a credit from &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; to &ldquo;Pursuing&rdquo; must be done manually by going through each credit. The reason that AASHE marks an institution\'s credits as \"In Progress\" when a migration is complete is because we don\'t feel comfortable deciding what an institution may or may not \"Pursue\" after the migration process.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><a name=\"institutions_not_participating\" target=\"_self\"></a>For Institutions not participating in STARS</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>AASHE has created the Campus Sustainability Data Collector for institutions not currently participating in STARS. Institutions that register under the Campus Sustainability Data Collector are referred to as Survey Respondents. This basic tool allows any higher education institution the option to share campus sustainability data with The Princeton Review and/or Sierra Magazine. Please note, the Sustainable Endowments Institute has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://greenreportcard.org/media\" target=\"_self\">suspended</a>&nbsp;the production of the College Sustainability Report Card and will no longer be seeking data for this publication. The Data Collector is modeled after the STARS Reporting Tool and is available at no cost. However, this option does not include any of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/get-involved/campus-sustainability-data-collector/data-collector-benefits.html\" target=\"_self\">benefits</a>&nbsp;of the STARS Reporting Tool or those associated with being a STARS Participant.</p>\r\n<p>While the STARS Reporting Tool includes beneficial features like automated calculations, multiple user access, and data collection resources, the Campus Sustainability Data Collector is simply a place to upload and share sustainability data. This information is not available to the public and institutions that use the Data Collector will not receive any recognition other than submission to publications that they choose to share their data with.</p>\r\n<p>Once your institution has registered for the Data Collector, it will access the tool from the &ldquo;Reporting&rdquo; link in the toolbar at the top of the STARS website. Uploading of data will take place in the &ldquo;My Submission&rdquo; section of the Data Collector.&nbsp; Survey Respondents will be given the option to allow organizations outside of AASHE to have access to your data in the &ldquo;Share Data&rdquo; tab of the &ldquo;My Summary&rdquo; page in the Campus Sustainability Data Collector. Each institution has the ability to share their data with the organizations they choose by taking a &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; of the data marked as &lsquo;pursuing&rsquo; in the Data Collector.&nbsp; Instructions for how to successfully take and share a snapshot of data are outlined in the &ldquo;Share Data&rdquo; tab of the &ldquo;My Summary&rdquo; page in the Data Collector. Please note, The Princeton Review and Sierra magazine each have a different target audience and therefore may not include data from all institutions in their various publications.</p>\r\n<p>Institutions will need to be working in the most up-to-date version of the STARS Technical Manual in order to share data.&nbsp; Institutions that wish to <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/faqs/reporting-and-information-sharing.html\" target=\"_self\">migrate</a> their data to the latest version of STARS may do so by choosing the &ldquo;Migrate&rdquo; tab in the &ldquo;My Summary&rdquo; page of the Campus Sustainability Data Collector.&nbsp; Institutions that have a valid STARS rating but are not currently registered STARS Participants may migrate data from the STARS Reporting Tool to the Campus Sustainability Data Collector. This option is available at no cost. Please note, migrating data from the STARS Reporting Tool to the Campus Sustainability Data Collector may take some time, so please be patient.&nbsp; Also, once the migration is complete, each credit will be marked as &ldquo;In Progress.&rdquo; Only credits marked as &ldquo;Pursing&rdquo; will be captured in a snapshot of data to be shared with other organizations. Changing a credit from &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; to &ldquo;Pursuing&rdquo; must be done manually by going through each credit. The reason that AASHE marks an institution\'s credits as \"In Progress\" when a migration is complete is because we don\'t feel comfortable deciding what an institution may or may not \"Pursue\" after the migration process.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>*Please note, regardless of whether your institution is a STARS Participant or a Campus Sustainability Data Collector Survey Respondent it MUST take a snapshot of its data and share this information to be considered for another organizations\' publication.

The intent of this initiative is to reduce and streamline the amount of time campus staff spend tracking sustainability data and completing related surveys.</p>\r\n<p>To address this issue, The Princeton Review, Sierra magazine, and the Sustainable Endowments Institute have worked with AASHE to establish the Campus Sustainability Data Collector as the source for information needed to complete their publications (The Princeton Review Green Rating, Sierra magazine&rsquo;s Cool Schools issue, and the Sustainable Endowment Institute&rsquo;s College Sustainability Report Card, respectively.&nbsp; Please note, the Sustainable Endowments Institute has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://greenreportcard.org/media\" target=\"_self\">suspended</a>&nbsp;the production of the College Sustainability Report Card and will no longer be seeking data for this publication). In addition, there are some data points, not included in STARS, which these organizations are also interested in, that AASHE has identified as supplemental data in the reporting process. This will allow institutions that want to participate in the various programs to complete the information needed by each organization and enable the organizations to collect this information without having to send out individual surveys to institutions.</p>',NULL,'2013-02-07 12:50:06'),

This basic tool allows any higher  education institution the option to share campus sustainability data  with The Princeton Review and Sierra magazine. The Data Collector is modeled after the STARS  Reporting Tool and is available at no cost. &nbsp;However, this option does  not include many of the <a href=\"/pages/get-involved/campus-sustainability-data-collector/data-collector-benefits.html\" target=\"_self\">benefits</a> of the STARS Reporting Tool or those  associated with being a STARS Participant.</p>\r\n<p>Please note, the Sustainable Endowments Institute has <a href=\"http://greenreportcard.org/media\" target=\"_self\">suspended</a> the production of the College Sustainability Report Card and will no longer be seeking data for this publication.<br /><br /><strong><a name=\"aashe_member\" target=\"_self\"></a>Does a higher education institution have to be a member of AASHE to use the Campus Sustainability Data Collector?</strong><br />No, any institution in the U.S. or Canada can use this tool. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><a name=\"access\" target=\"_self\"></a>Who may use the Campus Sustainability Data Collector?</strong><br />Any higher education institution in the U.S. or Canada can register for the Data Collector. However, the Data Collector is especially relevant for those institutions who have previously participated in completing surveys for The Princeton Review, Sierra magazine, and the Sustainable Endowments Institute.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"access_data\" target=\"_self\"></a>Who has access to the data documented in the Campus Sustainability Data Collector?</strong><br />For   institutions that register as Survey Respondents and submit their data   through the Data Collector, this information may be shared with The Princeton Review and/or Sierra   magazine. Please note, the Sustainable Endowments Institute has <a href=\"http://greenreportcard.org/media\" target=\"_self\">suspended</a> the production of the College Sustainability Report Card and will no longer be seeking data for this publication.</p>\r\n<p>Once a snapshot of the information in the Data Collector has   been taken, Survey Respondents   will no longer have access to their data. Only active STARS   Participants, who have access to the STARS Reporting Tool, will be able   to continually access their data even after they have submitted for a   STARS rating or shared their information with these other organizations. Institutions may contact the organization the data was shared with for a copy of this information.<strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"cost\" target=\"_self\"></a>What does it cost to become a Campus Sustainability Data Collector Survey Respondent?</strong><br />The Data Collector is available at no cost to  institutions. Though it looks very similar to the STARS Reporting Tool,  the primary difference between the Data Collector and the STARS  Reporting Tool is that the Data Collector does not include any of the  <a href=\"/pages/get-involved/campus-sustainability-data-collector/data-collector-benefits.html\" target=\"_self\">benefits</a> of the STARS Reporting Tool.<br /><br /><strong><a name=\"different_from_stars\" target=\"_self\"></a>How is the Campus Sustainability Data Collector different from STARS?</strong><br />AASHE  used the STARS Reporting Tool as the foundation for building the Data Collector.  The Data Collector platform is similar to the STARS Reporting Tool without access  to all of the <a href=\"/pages/get-involved/campus-sustainability-data-collector/data-collector-benefits.html\" target=\"_self\">benefits</a> such as resources, automated scoring, reports,  etc. The Data Collector is a vehicle for sharing data only. The STARS Reporting Tool  allows institutions to both share and track their data over time through  data management software. <br /><br /><strong><a name=\"stars_benefits\" target=\"_self\"></a>What are the benefits of participating in STARS as opposed to reporting data in the Campus Sustainability Data Collector?</strong><br />There  are several benefits associated with being a STARS Participant as  opposed to reporting data in the Data Collector. Please see the <a href=\"/pages/get-involved/campus-sustainability-data-collector/data-collector-benefits.html\" target=\"_self\">benefits</a> page for  more information.<br /><br /><strong><a name=\"stars_participant_reporting\" target=\"_self\"></a>If I&rsquo;m registered for STARS, do I also need to report data in the Campus Sustainability Data Collector?</strong><br />No.  In the STARS Reporting Tool, STARS Participants will be able to  complete not only the STARS data fields, but also the <a href=\"#supplemental_fields\" target=\"_self\">supplemental section</a>, which outlines information requested by the other rating  organizations. All data documented in an institution&rsquo;s STARS Report may  be shared directly through the STARS Reporting Tool.</p>\r\n<p>Once a STARS  Participant\'s subscription period expires, the institution will no  longer have access to the STARS Reporting Tool.&nbsp; At this time the  institution will automatically be registered as a Campus Sustainability  Data Collector Survey Respondent. Institutions that are registered  Survey Respondents may use the Data Collector to document data and share  this information with The Princeton Review and Sierra magazine.&nbsp; Please note, the Sustainable Endowments Institute has <a href=\"http://greenreportcard.org/media\" target=\"_self\">suspended</a> the production of the College Sustainability Report Card and will no longer be seeking data for this publication.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"complete_report\" target=\"_self\"></a>If my institution completed a STARS Report, do I need to do anything to share data with Sierra magazine or The Princeton Review?</strong><br /> Yes.&nbsp;All institutions that wish to share data to be considered for another organization\'s publication MUST take and share a snapshot of data.

Data saved in the Data Collector prior to the  migration  will be visible in the Reporting Tool once the migration is  complete.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Data Migrations&rdquo; allow Survey Responders to migrate previously   saved data sets into the Campus Sustainability Data Collector. For  example, institutions  may choose to pull data from a previously  submitted STARS Report, or  saved snapshot, into the Data Collector.  Completing a \'Data  Migration\' will allow the institution to work off of  the specific data  set that is moved into the Data Collector instead of  documenting  data from scratch. Migrating data  will replace any  previously saved  data.</p>\r\n<p>Survey Responders seeking to migrate data will use the migration    function in the STARS Reporting Tool by navigating to the \'My Summary\'    page and choosing the \'Migrate\' tab.&nbsp; Please note that it may take a    few minutes for migration to complete, during which time the \'My    Submission\' section of the Reporting Tool will be locked.&nbsp; All credits   are marked as  &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; after migration is complete.&nbsp; Changes to   credit status  must be done manually.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"supplemental_fields\" target=\"_self\"></a>What are supplemental data? </strong><br />These  are reporting fields outside of those outlined in the STARS Technical  Manual and Reporting Tool, that Sierra magazine would like institutions to  complete for their surveys. At this time, Sierra magazine is only seeking data for <em>SD-10: Energy Use by Type</em>. These fields do not impact a STARS Rating  and will not be posted publicly in an institution&rsquo;s STARS Report. Please note, the Sustainable Endowments Institute has <a href=\"http://greenreportcard.org/media\" target=\"_self\">suspended</a> the production of the College Sustainability Report Card and will no longer be seeking data for this publication.</p>\r\n<p>Institutions must be working in STARS 1.2 to access the supplemental section.&nbsp; If an institution needs to migrate data from an earlier version of STARS to STARS 1.2, it may do so by choosing the \"Migrate\" link in the box at the top of the \"My Submission\" page of the STARS Reporting Tool or Campus Sustainability Data Collector.&nbsp; Please note, during the migration process an institution will not have access to the Reporting Tool or Data Collector.&nbsp; Once the migration is successful, institutions will be able to view the supplemental data in the \"My Submission\" section of the Reporting Tool or Data Collector.&nbsp; View a complete list of the fields in the <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/documents/STARS/supplemental_data.pdf\" target=\"_self\">supplemental section</a> (pdf).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"information_to_complete\" target=\"_self\"></a>How do I know what information to complete for each organization?</strong><br />The Princeton Review and Sierra magazine have identified the specific data fields of particular interest   that they are looking for institutions to complete.

Credits are normalized by both weighted campus users and gross square feet of building space.</li>\r\n<li>The use of baselines in STARS has been changed significantly to give granting institutions greater flexibility in setting baselines for GHG emissions, energy consumption, waste generation and water use.</li>\r\n<li>Performance thresholds have been introduced into several credits to complement the use of baselines.

There wasn&rsquo;t enough time to answer the following questions on the air (many questions have been consolidated to avoid redundancy). *Please note the information discussed during this webinar is in reference to STARS 1.0, a previous version of the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Participation Logistics</h2>\r\n<p><strong>What is the expected timeline for completing a STARS assessment?</strong><br /> Each STARS Participant has 12 months from its registration date to complete its data submission.  However, institutions may submit a request for an extension if they are unable to complete their data submission within the 12-month timeframe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How many people typically are involved in the process?</strong><br /> The way institutions gather STARS data is entirely up to the individual institution.  This task can be completed by a professor and his/her class, a master\'s student, through the institution\'s administration, as a Facilities Management project, or by the Sustainability officer--to name a few scenarios.  The process can involve one person to hundreds depending on the model the institution chooses.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are the costs and how are they used?</strong><br /> The registration fee for STARS depends on whether your institution is an AASHE member.  The registration fee for AASHE members is $900 and the registration fee for non-members is $1,400.  Fees are put towards the further development of the STARS program including resources for STARS Participants such as ongoing enhancements to the STARS website and Reporting Tool, as well as workshops and webinars.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Some of my colleagues here are wondering if we submit all our data and don\'t like the rating we get if we can essentially suppress access to our data and the rating altogether until we improve what we do to get the rating we desire.</strong><br /> One of the benefits of STARS is transparency; all data submitted will be made public.  However, there are a couple of things that address this concern:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You&rsquo;ll know your score before completing the submission; a &ldquo;provisional score&rdquo; is displayed throughout the reporting process.</li>\r\n<li>Participation in STARS is entirely voluntary.  You may choose to omit any credits that you choose (though you would not earn points for those credits).</li>\r\n<li>Your institution can choose to submit its data as a STARS Reporter, instead of for a rating, and your score will not be shown with your data.  All institutions may choose Reporter status when finalizing their submissions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>My institution is not yet a member of AASHE.  I would like to try out STARS for 1-2 weeks and see if it&rsquo;s a good fit for us.  If it is, we would consider joining AASHE.  Will you be offering a free trial?</strong><br /> Although AASHE is not offering a free-trial of the program at this time, you may download the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> for free.  The Technical Manual outlines all of the STARS credits and the documentation required for each credit.  You will not have access to the STARS Reporting Tool unless you register to participate, but you can tune in to February&rsquo;s webinar <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/stars-webinars/?root_category=news-events\" target=\"_self\">&ldquo;STARS Reporting Tool 101&rdquo;</a> for a detailed preview of how online reporting for STARS works.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What kinds of recognition can STARS participants receive?</strong><br /> Participants will earn STARS Ratings, which they can use to publicize their sustainability leadership.  AASHE will recognize participants on its website, the STARS annual report, and other publicity.  In addition, AASHE expects that the media and prospective students will use STARS participation as an indicator of sustainability leadership.</p>\r\n<p>Institutions that register before August 20, 2010, will be recognized as STARS Charter Participants.  Charter Participants will be acknowledged as pioneers of STARS and will receive a special logo to use on their websites and print materials.  AASHE will provide additional resources to Charter Participants, including a sample press release.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How  does a university system or community college district participate in STARS?  Do you recommend our colleges join separately or can the system join as one institution?</strong><br /> University systems or community college districts may register for STARS and report as one entity or each institution may register independently.  One registration covers one submission and each system can decide which scale is appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>To determine whether to register as a district or individually, it may be worth looking at <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">the STARS credits</a> and the associated reporting fields.  If most data are gathered centrally, such that it would be difficult to disaggregate information for separate campuses, it may make sense to register as one system.  If most information is tracked at the individual institution level, it may be more appropriate for each college to register independently.   Another consideration is how valuable it would be to benchmark the performance of individual institutions against each other.  If you&rsquo;d like to be able to do this type of comparison, it may be worth registering institutions independently.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the Dallas County Community College District, Eastern Iowa Community College District, and Los Angeles Community College District are participating in STARS as districts instead of individual colleges.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is it too late to become a Charter Participant?</strong><br /> The deadline to become a STARS Charter Participant is August 20, 2010.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I know you and I are concerned with colleges&mdash;but is there a system (or can STARS be edited to be that system) that works for elementary and secondary schools or a single K-12 school site?</strong><br /> STARS participation is limited to colleges and universities (i.e., institutions that are accredited as such and/or confer degrees).  Since STARS was developed specifically for colleges and universities, opening up the system to broader participation would create confusion and strain on the nascent program.</p>\r\n<p>That said, the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> is available on our website and you\'re welcome to use relevant credits or sections of the system to conduct an assessment.  We\'d be happy to answer any questions that arise as you look through the document and apologize that we can\'t make the program available to secondary schools at this time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It was mentioned that a rating will last up to three years.  Can you submit every year for a new rating?</strong><br /> An institution may register for STARS every year, even though the STARS rating is valid for three years.  Each time an institution registers for STARS, a registration fee applies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve been told that once rated that if a school wants to update their data/information that the institution would then have to re-register and pay an additional fee.  Will users who are not using the rating but just listing of the data be able to update information without re-registering? </strong><br /> Each time a campus wants to update its submission, it will need to register and pay a fee. This includes schools that are interested in being a STARS Reporter and those pursuing a rating.  Access to the Reporting Tool, one of the primary benefits of STARS, is tied to the registration fee. Therefore, a campus should be certain that their STARS documentation is accurate when submitting for a rating because changes will not be allowed until a school re-registers and begins the process of submitting for a STARS rating again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>My university has decided that we will not become a STARS participant this year.  Since I do not represent the entire university, only the Associated Students, I&rsquo;m wondering if it is possible for me to submit a partial report for my campus that only speaks to certain sections of the campus which I represent. </strong><br /> As the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">Technical Manual</a> says, participation in STARS is intended for entire colleges and universities.  This may change over time, but at this point, there are a couple key reasons to limit it in that way.  The primary challenge rises from the fact that one of the main advantages of STARS is to allow benchmarking between institutions.  Benchmarking segments of institutions is much trickier.  For instance, AS serves all students but operates only some of the buildings on campus.  As a result, the building energy consumption per student covered by this STARS assessment would be misleadingly low.  Further, another goal of the program is to help foster connections across the university.  By opening STARS up to separate departments, that type of cross-department collaboration is limited.</p>\r\n<h2>STARS Reporting Tool</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Will there be an online reporting tool for STARS like the ACUPCC site? If so, when will it be available?</strong><br /> The STARS Reporting Tool is completely online and is similar to the <a href=\"http://acupcc.aashe.org/\" target=\"_self\">ACUPCC Reporting System</a>.   The Reporting Tool was released on January 19th as part of the STARS 1.0 launch.  STARS Participants can access the Reporting Tool by visiting the STARS website.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can we preview the tool right now? </strong><br /> At this time only STARS Participants may access the Reporting Tool.  However, AASHE will be hosting a webinar called &ldquo;STARS Reporting Tool 101&rdquo; on February 16 that will cover the specifics of how to use the Reporting Tool.  More information will be added to the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/stars-webinars/?root_category=news-events\" target=\"_self\">webinar website</a> as it becomes available.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you go back to different sections as you fill it in and more information becomes available or is it a one-time submission?</strong><br /> Institutions have one year following registration to complete their submissions.  An institution can go back and edit its submission throughout that period.  However, once a submission is finalized, it may not be edited.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How does the tool actually help us track?  Does it actually track waste, water, energy and greenhouse gases? </strong><br /> The STARS Reporting Tool tracks all of the required documentation for each credit listed in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>. This includes information related to waste, water, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions. We encourage you to take a look at the Operations section of the Technical Manual and look through the Reporting Fields that are listed for each credit. This will be the exact information that will be tracked with the online Reporting Tool. In February, there will be an online demonstration of the STARS Reporting Tool to give campuses a better sense of how it works. Stay tuned to our website for more information.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is the tool downloadable (say into Excel or Access) so we don&rsquo;t have 50 people entering information online?  We want to have 1 or 2 people complete the final submission.</strong><br /> The STARS Reporting Tool is not downloadable into Excel or Word.  All information will be entered directly online.  There are a couple options to address your concern within our current structure.</p>\r\n<p><em>Option A </em>-- There are three user levels within the Reporting Tool -- Administrator, Data Entry, and Observers.  Only users with \"Administrator\" privileges are able to complete the final submission.  As an \"Administrator\" you can assign other users \"Data Entry\" status so that they can go in and input data, but you would still be able to verify everything before finishing the submission.  (You can also remove a user\'s Data Entry privileges at any time if you wanted to set aside a period of time in which only one or two users had access to the account.)</p>\r\n<p><em>Option B</em> -- The STARS Technical Manual (available online) lists all of the Reporting Fields associated with each credit -- the list in the Manual is the same as what is in the Reporting Tool.  You can use these lists of reporting fields to inform your data collection process.  I\'m not sure how you\'re planning to approach data collection, but there are a couple of options within this approach.  For instance, you could direct the relevant data gatherers to the Technical Manual, you could copy and paste the lists of reporting fields and distribute them to the relevant parties, or you could follow any number of approaches here.  After you get the responses back from the various data gatherers, you could then input the data into the Reporting Tool yourself (or have one or two others do it).</p>\r\n<p><strong>While completing entries for the credits, are those made public immediately after we save the entry?</strong><br /> When you save your entry for a particular credit, it is not made publicly available immediately.  The submission will be made public only after the entire submission is finalized (and you\'ll be warned and notified in case you accidentally jump the gun on this step).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Does the STARS Reporting Tool provide a platform for data entry and report generation?</strong><br /> The Reporting Tool provides a platform for entering data.  It does not yet generate reports, but that is a feature we\'re working on adding.  <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/help/\" target=\"_self\">Let us know</a> if you have any suggestions for what types of reports would be most useful -- we\'re working on implementing some things already, but welcome suggestions for additional reports and features that would make the tool most useful to participants.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the difference between STARS and Clean Air-Cool Planet\'s Campus Carbon Calculator or </strong><strong>the BC Provincial Government&rsquo;s SMARTTool for mandatory Green House Gas Emission Reduction Reporting?</strong><br /> Greenhouse gas emissions inventorying tools, like the Campus Carbon Calculator, complement STARS.&nbsp; STARS is not a GHG emissions inventory tool -- for the credit based on GHG emissions, users enter their total emissions in terms of CO2 equivalent, not the raw energy or fuel inputs.</p>\r\n<p>STARS includes a couple credits that will be easier to report on and earn as a result of using an inventorying tool (OP Credit 4: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, OP Credit 5: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction, and PAE Credit 5: Climate Plan).  The specific reporting fields associated with each of those credits are outlined in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>.  STARS does not require that a specific GHG emissions calculator or inventory tool be used; the only stipulation is that the inventory adheres to the GHG Protocol\'s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards.  The Campus Carbon Calculator does meet this standard.  I suspect that the SMARTTOOL also meets this standard (it\'s the authoritative standard for this type of tool), but I wasn\'t able to verify that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>STARS Credits</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Will the online score sheet be available to all AASHE members soon? (We&rsquo;d like to work through the process before enrolling in STARS.)</strong><br /> While the STARS Reporting Tool is available only to Participants, all institutions can view the STARS credits now.  The <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> details the credit criteria and the documentation required for each credit.  Since the Reporting Tool includes the same reporting fields that are outlined in the Technical Manual, you can use the Technical Manual to work through the STARS process before enrolling in STARS.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to preview the STARS Reporting Tool, tune into our February Webinar: &ldquo;STARS Reporting Tool 101.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Will STARS be structured to allow for the introduction of completely new strategies in sustainability?</strong><br /> The Innovation category of STARS provides an avenue for institutions to highlight their sustainability efforts that go above and beyond the STARS credits.  More information about Innovation credits is available in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the relationship between STARS and a Campus Sustainability plan?</strong><br /> STARS includes a credit &ndash; PAE Credit 4: Sustainability Plan -- that recognizes institutions that have completed a sustainability plan.  (You may view the criteria for this credit in the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\">STARS 1.0 Technical Manual</a>.)  STARS also provides a valuable framework for institutions looking to develop sustainability plans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do students, staff, faculty, and administrators fit into the categories that you have outlined (e.g., operations, education &amp; research, etc.)?</strong><br /> STARS credits are organized into categories that are meant to cover the functional areas of colleges and universities, not campus stakeholder groups.  As a result, these campus groups don&rsquo;t separate perfectly into the STARS categories.  Indeed, one of the goals of STARS is to facilitate sustainability work that transcends these groupings.</p>\r\n<p>While no perfect groupings exist, faculty and students may find the Education &amp; Research category especially relevant.  Administrators may find credits in the Planning, Administration &amp; Engagement category particularly relevant.  Staff members may be drawn to any of the three categories, depending on their areas of focus (e.g., a facilities staff member would find the Operations credit most relevant while a community service coordinator would find the PAE category most relevant).</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Credit Checklist</a>, which provides a quick snapshot of the STARS credits, may provide a useful guide for understanding how various groups can contribute to each of the STARS categories.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How different are the early release technical manual and the current STARS January release?</strong><br /> No major changes were made between the STARS 1.0 Technical Manual and the Early Release edition. The <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/documents/STARS/Technical_Manual_Changes.pdf\" target=\"_self\">Record of Changes</a> (pdf) details the differences between the documents.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I am working on a disposal policy fort campus materials&mdash;everything from desks and landscape materials to construction waste&mdash;where does a policy like this fit into STARS?</strong><br /> The Operations category of STARS includes a Waste sub-category.  You can view the credits and their required documentation in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The development of a disposal policy could contribute to the achievement of several of the STARS credits concerning waste.  A disposal policy could contribute to the reduction of waste on campus, the waste diversion, recycling of campus materials, as well as the management of hazardous waste--all of which are addressed in the STARS credits on waste.</p>\r\n<p>I encourage you to read the Waste sub-category in the Operations category of STARS and use STARS as a guide while developing your disposal policy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What professional roles and benchmark standards are recommended for residence education within college/university\'s department of Housing and Residence Life?</strong><br /> Housing and residence life departments play an important role in advancing campus sustainability and can contribute to achieving several STARS credits.  The Co-Curricular Education sub-category, which focuses on student learning outside of the classroom, may be of particular interest.  The Co-Curricular Education subcategory includes the following credits (you can find full details about these credits in the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\"><em>STARS 1.0 Technical Manual</em></a>): ER Credit 1: Student Sustainability Educators Program, ER Credit 2: Student Sustainability Outreach Campaign, ER Credit 3: Sustainability in New Student Orientation, ER Credit 4: Sustainability Outreach and Publications, Tier Two 1: Student Group, Tier Two 2: Organic Garden, Tier Two 3: Model Dorm Room, Tier Two 4: Themed Housing, Tier Two 5: Sustainable Enterprise, Tier Two 6: Sustainability Events, Tier Two 7: Outdoors Program, Tier Two 8: Themed Semester or Year.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the Co-Curricular Education subcategory, residence life departments contribute to many other STARS credits as well.  For instance, credits in the Diversity and Affordability subcategory about student training in diversity issues may be achieved through residence life\'s program offerings.  Likewise, residence life\'s energy conservation, waste reduction, water conservation, and other operational initiatives can help institutions earn points in the Operations category.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Given that one of the goals of the STARS assessment is to provide criteria which work for most institutions, will there be a mechanism for individual colleges to make arguments for re-weighting their credits if the \"local perspective\"  does not necessarily match with the current weighting?</strong><br /> At this time, the weighting of STARS credits is consistent for all institutions; there isn\'t an option for institutions to re-assign different point values to the credits.</p>\r\n<p>You\'re certainly right that there isn\'t a perfect or one-size-fits-all approach to allocating points or determining which credits have the largest impacts. As with all aspects of STARS, we do hope to improve the point allocation methodology for future versions of the system.  One potential approach that we\'ve discussed is to follow LEED\'s model and accommodate regional variation by assigning certain credits regional priority points.  We\'ve discussed following the same strategy based on institution types as well (such that credits that are more important for community colleges are assigned additional points for those institutions, for example).  We hadn\'t previously considered opening it up to the individual institutions and letting them assign additional points or re-weight any of the credits, but that\'s an interesting idea.   One potential challenge with this approach would be making sure these additional points don\'t just become freebies.  It\'s easy to imagine an institution allocating these points to practices they have already implemented in order to increase its overall score, instead of adding points to the practices or outcomes that are the most impactful or meaningful given its context.  We\'d welcome additional suggestions or comments on how this may work or other ways to improve the point allocation methodology -- please send any suggestions to stars@aashe.org.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Speak about the credits weight as impact on the environment.</strong><br /> The <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\"><em>STARS 1.0 Technical Manual</em></a> describes how points were allocated. The relevant section (it\'s found on page 4 of the document) is copied below.</p>\r\n<p><em>While each Tier Two credit is worth 0.25 points, Tier One credits vary in the number of points they are worth.  Points were allocated using the following considerations:  <br /> </em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved environmental impacts?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved financial impacts?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved social impacts?</em></li>\r\n<li><em>To what extent are there educational benefits associated with the achievement of this credit?</em> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>How many people are impacted (breadth)? </em></li>\r\n<li><em>How deeply are people impacted (depth)?</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>As these questions indicate, the focus in allocating points was on the impact, not the difficulty, of earning the credit.  Some sustainability initiatives may be very difficult to implement but yield negligible impacts.  Conversely, some generally easier projects have significant impacts.  Assigning points based on the difficulty of earning a credit would create a perverse incentive for institutions to focus on the difficult projects or initiatives, which may not be the most meaningful or impactful. </em></p>\r\n<p><em>While AASHE has strived for a fair and consistent approach to allocating points, this is an inherently subjective exercise.  Developing a more robust point allocation methodology &ndash; including finding stronger ways to accommodate how regional variations and difference in institution type influence each institution&rsquo;s sustainability impacts &ndash; will be considered for future versions of STARS. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the difference between Tier One credits and Tier Two credits?&nbsp; </strong><br /> The description of Tier One vs. Tier Two credits from the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\"><em>STARS&nbsp;1.0 Technical Manual</em></a> (found on pages 3-4 of the document) is copied below:</p>\r\n<p><em>Each STARS credit that meets these four criteria is assigned a type: Tier One or Tier Two.  <br /> </em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Tier One credits &ndash; Tier One credits are worth one or more points each and are grouped in a subcategory (e.g., Curriculum) within a category (e.g., Education &amp; Research)</em></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Tier Two credits &ndash; Many of the subcategories in STARS include Tier Two credits, each of which is worth 0.25 points.  There are two reasons a credit is classified as Tier Two instead of Tier One. </em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Some Tier Two credits recognize strategies that merit recognition, but tend to have a smaller impact than Tier One credits.  For example, there is a Tier Two credit for institutions that have a bike-sharing program.  Having a bike-sharing program warrants recognition, but has a smaller impact on a campus&rsquo; impact than having significant numbers of students and employees use environmentally preferable modes for commuting, which are captured in Tier One credits. </em></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Other Tier Two credits promote strategies whose benefits are already largely captured by a Tier One credit.  For example, one Tier Two credit recognizes institutions that have a composting program.  While composting is an important sustainability strategy, the primary benefits of composting are captured by a Tier One credit on waste diversion. </em></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>STARS Reporter Status</h2>\r\n<p><strong>If you are a STARS Reporter is the information made public as well?</strong><br /> All institution data that are submitted through the STARS Reporting Tool will be made publicly available.  This applies to those institutions that submit their data as STARS Reporters or for a STARS rating.  Since STARS is a self-assessment framework, making the submissions public is a key strategy to ensure accuracy.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike institutions that earn a STARS rating, STARS Reporters will not have a score displayed with their submissions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I\'m wondering about the option to report as a STARS Reporter, without applying for a rating. Would we still require sign off from the president/chancellor? </strong><br /> Each institution that completes its STARS submission is required to submit a letter of affirmation from its highest executive (president or chancellor).  The letter from the institution&rsquo;s president or chancellor is an important strategy to help ensure that all information submitted is accurate.  Thus, the letter is required both for STARS Reporters and institutions that are pursuing a rating.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can a university sign up for Reporter status and switch to assessment when we gain confidence?</strong><br /> When your institution registers as a STARS Participant you do not have to indicate if you would like to be a STARS Reporter or pursue a rating.  As you document your data in the STARS Reporting Tool you will be able to see your provisional rating, which is based on points received from the completed credits, throughout the entire data documentation process.  Once you are ready to submit your institution\'s completed dataset, you can then indicate whether you would like to be identified as a STARS Reporter or by the STARS rating you have earned.</p>\r\n<h2>Relationships with Other Assessments</h2>\r\n<p><strong>What is the status of collaboration with other surveying groups such as SEI, Princeton Review, and Sierra Magazine? Are there any specific partnerships in the works?</strong><br /> AASHE is open to collaborating with any organization that can help us further our mission, including those that offer ratings or rankings for higher education. One of the main goals of STARS is to address survey fatigue and eliminate redundancy to more effectively meet the needs of the campus sustainability community. We have the support of our <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/governance/3978/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\">Founding Partners</a> and will be welcoming additional Partner Organizations this year. Information on AASHE partnerships related to STARS will be noted on our website.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is AASHE actively communicating with other organizations that have surveys to make them aware of what will be included in STARS?</strong><br /> AASHE hopes that the public data submitted through STARS will serve as the go-to place for information related to a college or university&rsquo;s sustainability performance. One of the goals of STARS is to reduce survey fatigue that many campus sustainability staff experience.  We will be encouraging other organizations with ratings, rankings, or surveys, to use the information submitted to the STARS Reporting Tool. Though we have not actively pursued this type of collaboration yet, it will be a part of our outreach efforts moving forward.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How does STARS interact/collaborate with the College Sustainability Report Card, if at all?</strong><br /> STARS is a program of AASHE and is separate from the Green Report Card (as well as other ratings and rankings) but we have collaborated with the Sustainable Endowments Institute (who puts out the Report Card) in the past and hope to again in the future. We will be encouraging anyone, including other organizations with ratings, rankings, or surveys, to use information that is submitted through the STARS Reporting Tool in the hopes of reducing the survey fatigue that many campus sustainability staff experience.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If I understand, STARS is a comprehensive environmental management system (EMS) that was designed to assist institutions with sustainability transformation initiatives.  Understandably different than ranking systems, where institutions compete for a specific ranking, how else is STARS aligned to better suit 21st Century sustainability initiatives in the United States and Canada, when compared to EMS systems, such as, the International Standardization Organization\'s system (ISO) 14000/ISO19011?</strong><br /> Both ISO 14000 or 19011 and STARS can serve as valuable tools for campuses.  There are a couple key differences between these EMS\' and STARS.  In addition to the differences between rating systems and management systems, which you mentioned, there are two major differences worth highlighting:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>STARS was developed by and for higher education.  As such, it includes credits unique to higher education, like curriculum and research.  Likewise, the credits in other areas, such as investment or operations, are informed by a higher education perspective.</li>\r\n<li>STARS is a sustainability system (rather than strictly environmental), and consistent with the long-standing definition of sustainability, includes indicators related to institutions\' social, environmental, and economic performance.  An EMS focuses on environmental pieces.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Have you geared STARS to any other global Sustainability system such as Global Reporting Initiative?</strong><br /> AASHE consulted several other sustainability reporting and assessment frameworks, including GRI, when developing the STARS credits.  STARS and GRI are similar in several ways.  Both systems are consistent with the long-standing definition of sustainability and include social, economic, and environmental considerations.  Likewise, both systems emphasize transparency in reporting (all data that institutions submit for a STARS rating will be made publicly available).  Since GRI and STARS have these similarities, GRI was an excellent source when brainstorming STARS credits and we try to stay up-to-speed with their activities and learn from their good work.</p>\r\n<p>That said, there are some key differences between the systems too.  First, STARS was developed by and for colleges and universities, so it covers topics specific to higher education like curriculum and research, which GRI does not include.  Similarly, GRI is not a rating system; it\'s a reporting framework.  While STARS works as a reporting framework, it is also a rating system.  In this way, STARS is organized into a series of credits, whereas GRI is organized as a series of reporting fields.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How does STARS compare/fit in with LEED?  How is it different? </strong><br /> There are several similarities between STARS and LEED:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Structure </strong>-- Both systems are based on a checklist of credits organized into different categories.  Likewise, both systems have Innovation credits to recognize new and innovative practices that aren\'t captured by the checklist.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Levels of Recognition</strong> -- Both systems include multiple levels of recognition (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) to signify progressively higher achievement.  (STARS includes an additional recognition level (STARS Reporter) for institutions that aren\'t pursuing a rating but are still demonstrating leadership by participating in the system.)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Positive Recognition</strong> -- Both systems offer only positive recognition.  Just as all levels of LEED certification signify green building leadership, all of the STARS levels are positive indications of campus sustainability leadership.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are a couple key differences between STARS and LEED:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Audience </strong>-- A LEED certification pertains to one building.  A STARS rating covers an entire college or university.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scope </strong>-- Since LEED certification is specific to buildings, LEED credits are generally focused on the specific features and aspects of the building.  Since STARS covers an entire institution, the credits cover a broader range of activities.  For example, STARS covers an institution\'s curriculum, research, purchasing, human resources, transportation, and other activities.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Certification vs. Assessment</strong> -- LEED is a certification that is verified by a third-party.  STARS is a self-assessment framework that incorporates a couple different strategies to ensure that the reported information is accurate.  First, all data reported to earn a STARS Rating are made publicly available.  Second, each credit must be accompanied by an affirmation from a responsible party attesting to the accuracy of the information submitted (the responsible party\'s name will accompany the public submission).  Third, each submission must be accompanied by a letter from the institution\'s highest executive (President or Chancellor) affirming the accuracy of the entire submission.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Because LEED focuses specifically on buildings and STARS looks at entire campuses, we see the rating systems as very complementary.  Indeed, STARS recognizes green buildings as a key component of campus sustainability and that LEED is the leading green building standard in the US and Canada.  As such, STARS includes two credits (OP Credit 1: Building Operations and Maintenance and OP Credit 2: Building Design and Construction) that award points for having LEED certified campus buildings.  (Additional details about these credits are available in the <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/3993/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\"><em>STARS 1.0 Technical Manual</em></a>.)  We are excited that the U.S. Green Building Council (the organization that developed and administers LEED) was involved in the STARS development process and is a <a href=\"http://stars.aashe.org/pages/governance/3978/?root_category=about\" target=\"_self\">STARS Founding Partner</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>AASHE Membership</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Do you have to be a member of AASHE to use the STARS program?</strong><br /> No, you do not have to be an AASHE member to participate in the STARS program.  All colleges and universities in the United States and Canada are welcome to participate.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The registration fee for non-member institutions is $1,400.</li>\r\n<li>The registration fee for AASHE&nbsp;member institutions is $900.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your institution may consider becoming a member of AASHE to take advantage of the member rate when registering for STARS.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Does the AASHE membership fee cover STARS registration? </strong><br /> The STARS registration fee is separate from the AASHE membership fee.  AASHE members received a discount on STARS registration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why can\'t individuals join AASHE?</strong><br /> AASHE membership focuses on colleges and universities.  The <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/membership/Institutional_Membership.php\" target=\"_self\">description of institutional membership in AASHE</a> explains the advantages of a full campus membership, rather than individual memberships: <br /> <em>An institutional membership connects your campus with leading edge colleges, universities and organizations working toward a sustainable world.  Membership covers every individual at your institution - so the entire campus can take advantage of AASHE member benefits. This type of membership is virtually unique among higher education associations, but necessary since all sectors of campus must work collaboratively and learn from each other in advancing sustainability.  Join the AASHE community today!</em></p>\r\n<p>If individual faculty members, students, staff or administrators were to join, it would be harder to get the commitment of the entire institution and to work across sectors, which is necessary for campus sustainability work.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to college and university memberships, AASHE offers an array of business memberships, which we refer to as the Business Alliance program.  Dues for participation in the Business Alliance vary based on the size of the company and level of benefits.  <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/about/business.php\" target=\"_self\">More information about the Business Alliance program is available online</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Other</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Can a vendor/supplier of sustainability products apply for STARS Certification for Universities to apply towards their STARS Rating?</strong><br /> STARS is a self-assessment for colleges and universities. Participating schools receive a rating. It is not a certification system and STARS does not endorse products. However, products with certain attributes or products that deliver a specific outcome may contribute to campuses earning credits in STARS. I encourage you to check out the STARS Credit Checklist for an overview of the credits and review the details included in the <a href=\"https://stars.aashe.org/pages/about/technical-manual.html\" target=\"_self\">STARS Technical Manual</a> for more specific information including credit criteria.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our university will register for STARS this year and plans to hire a third party consultant to help with the effort. Do you have any advice for working with these types of consultants?  How does one go about identifying local qualified consultants who can assist universities in conducting a STARs assessment?</strong><br /> Since STARS has just launched, we don&rsquo;t yet have a sense of the experiences of those campuses that have worked with consultants on their data collection process. We welcome participating schools to post ideas and feedback to AASHE\'s <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/forums\" target=\"_self\">Campus Sustainability Discussion Forums</a>, a great resource for STARS Participants. In time, AASHE will offer suggestions and perhaps even guidelines for how campuses can best accomplish their STARS assessment internally or through a third party consultant. At this point, we would encourage campuses to be sure that the consultant is familiar with the STARS Technical Manual and the credit requirements. It would also be good to make sure a consultant is familiar with the process of using the STARS Reporting Tool. There will be a webinar in February that will provide an online demonstration of how the Reporting Tool works.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Will there be more training available for faculty to infuse sustainability into the curriculum (in addition to AASHE\'s workshops)? </strong><br /> In addition to the <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/events/workshops/curriculum\" target=\"_self\">Sustainability Across the Curriculum Leadership Workshops</a>, AASHE&rsquo;s annual conference includes sessions and workshops on sustainability curriculum.  <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/conf2010\" target=\"_self\"><em>AASHE 2010</em></a>, our next conference, will take place in Denver, Colorado, from October 10 to 12. <a href=\"http://www2.aashe.org/conf2008/\" target=\"_self\"> Archives from the 2008 conference</a> are available online.</p>\r\n<p>Additional training opportunities will be announced in the <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/publications/bulletin.php\" target=\"_self\"><em>AASHE Bulletin</em></a>, our free, weekly newsletter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Knowing the urgency to address climate change immediately; knowing the extent of change required in reducing the energy intensity of our energy use, food production and diet, building operations, transportation and waste generation patterns and habits; is it not necessary for Higher Ed to shift to draconian measures such as banning cars on campus, reducing meat offerings for dining services, going to a paperless communications system, etc. immediately?  Is it reasonable to think we can take 20 years of collegial dialogue and discussion to move this agenda?</strong><br /> AASHE certainly recognizes the importance and immediacy of the challenges we are facing today. We think STARS will be a powerful tool in addressing sustainability challenges, especially since STARS recognizes outcomes and focuses on performance. STARS provides guidelines for embracing sustainability but also allows flexibility for campuses to decide the best approach. To learn more about these approaches or get other perspectives, we encourage you to start a conversation using AASHE&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/forums\" target=\"_self\">Campus Sustainability Discussion Forums</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Are there templates available for a letter to send to departments and administrators about STARS?</strong><br /> We don\'t have template letters yet, but this is a great suggestion and we\'ll work on developing them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Does STARS have a Life Cycle Analysis tool for materials used on Campuses?</strong><br /> STARS does not have a lifecycle analysis tool for materials used on campus.  I suspect many institutions would benefit from such an instrument, but it\'s beyond the scope of the program at this time.  You may wish to post this question to AASHE\'s <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/forums\" target=\"_self\">Campus Sustainability Discussion Forums</a> to see if others have resources to recommend.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Chris O&rsquo;Brien mentioned incorporating sustainability initiatives into the American University campus grounds department. Could you give us a brief overview of what is being done?</strong><br /> From Chris O&rsquo;Brien: We are about to become a pilot campus for <a href=\"http://www.sustainablesites.org\" target=\"_self\">Sustainable Sites</a>. This is sustainable grounds-keeping program builds on LEED but goes much deeper in the area of grounds. They are still seeking pilot campuses, so I encourage you to considering applying.</p>\r\n<p><strong>As the recently appointed Director of Sustainability at American University, how have you (the position) been received by the campus community? </strong><br /> From Chris O&rsquo;Brien: My role at AU has been received with open arms by everyone I encounter on campus. I have approached people all across the campus community to introduce them to STARS and request their participation in the credits relevant to their function. In most cases, I have found that people are doing sustainability activities already which weren&rsquo;t centrally planned or organized. In a number of cases, when I have asked people to do specific sustainability activities, they have responded with: &ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s great. I have suggested this in the past, so I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re asking me to do it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In short, there has been latent sustainability energy lying just under the surface all over our campus. Tasking an office and an individual with planning, implementing and tracking sustainability has made all the difference in turning that latent energy into real activities. People feel that their sustainability efforts are now part of a bigger picture. Because they see how their efforts are contributing to a shared goal, they can also share in the success once we achieve our STARS rating.</p>',1,'webinars','',NULL,'2013-08-12 11:11:25'),

Each STARS credit was vetted using the following questions:</em></p>\r\n<p><em>1. Does the credit speak to improved environmental, social, and/or financial impacts?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>2. Is the credit relevant and meaningful for diverse institutions?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>3. If the credit is based on the presence of a strategy, is a performance-based indicator not available or appropriate?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>4. Is the credit measurable, objective, and actionable?</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>STARS credits were developed in large part by reviewing campus sustainability assessments, sustainability reports from businesses, and other sustainability rating and ranking systems. For STARS 1.0 the initial credits from the STARS Pilot were revised or eliminated and new credits were added based on feedback from hundreds of diverse stakeholders and experts. In addition, STARS credits were vetted using four criteria.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>In order to be included, each credit must lead to improved environmental, social, and/or economic performance by colleges and universities. While the sphere of impact may vary each credit should indicate a movement toward sustainability.</li>\r\n<li>Given the diversity of higher education institutions, each STARS credit should be appropriate for most institution types. In order to accommodate this diversity, some STARS credits do not include detailed specifications but are instead flexible or open. In other cases, credits include an applicability criterion, so that the credit only applies to certain types of institutions.</li>\r\n<li>STARS strives to prioritize performance over strategy when possible. Performance credits are based on measurements of sustainability performance while strategy credits focus on approaches or processes that can help improve an institution\'s performance. In many instances, however, measurable, meaningful, and fairly comparable performance indicators could not be identified, so a strategy-based credit was used. As a result, both strategy and performance credits have a place in the system.</li>\r\n<li>AASHE strived to ensure that each credit was objective, measurable, and actionable.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Points were allocated using the following considerations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved environmental impacts?</li>\r\n<li>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved financial impacts?</li>\r\n<li>To what extent does the credit contribute to improved social impacts?</li>\r\n<li>To what extent are there educational benefits associated with the achievement of this credit?                                      \r\n<ul type=\"circle\">\r\n<li>How many people are impacted (breadth)?&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>How deeply are people impacted (depth)?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Tier One and Tier Two Credits</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WordSection1\">\r\n<p>Each STARS credit that meets these four criteria listed above (see also &ldquo;gatekeeper questions&rdquo; textbox) is classified as Tier One or Tier Two.&nbsp; The differences between Tier One and Tier Two credits are outlined below:</p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"height: 0px;\"><strong>Tier One</strong></td>\r\n<td style=\"height: 0px;\"><strong>Tier Two</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"height: 0px;\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Strive to capture measurable outcome</li>\r\n<li><span>Vary in the number of points they are worth</span></li>\r\n<li><span><span>Grouped in a subcategory (e.g. Curriculum) within a category (e.g. Education &amp; Research)</span><br /></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style=\"height: 0px;\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Acknowledge strategies and tend to have a smaller impact than Tier One credits</li>\r\n<li><span>Promote strategies whose benefits are already captured by a Tier One credit</span></li>\r\n<li><span><span>Worth 0.25 points each</span><br /></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>',1,'1x-organization','',NULL,'2013-08-08 10:41:31'),

Institutions that participated in the pilot tested the system and provided feedback to AASHE to help shape future versions of STARS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The STARS pilot project took place in two phases. A phased approach helped to moderate the workload for participating institutions. It also allowed AASHE to solicit another round of feedback about some sections included in STARS before asking schools to gather data.</p>\r\n<p>Phase One of the STARS pilot started in February 2008. Phase One covers the Operations category and about half of the Administration and Finance category.

Using a case study research design, I took a multi-disciplinary approach to the data collection for STARS implementation. Through my research I found that STARS is an effective tool to evaluate sustainability at Evergreen, which led to organizational learning, and highlighted Evergreen&rsquo;s complex and dynamic commitment to sustainability.</address>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/documents/STARS/Murphy_STARS_Evergreen.pdf\" target=\"_self\">Thesis presentation</a> (pdf)<br /> <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/files/resources/student-research/2009/Murphy_K MESThesis_2009.pdf\" target=\"_self\">Thesis full text</a> (pdf)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong><a name=\"Institutions_Participating_in_the_STARS_Pilot\" target=\"_self\"></a>Institutions Participating in the STARS Pilot</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Institutions are listed below according to their basic Carnegie Classification and student population.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Associate\'s Colleges</strong></h2>\r\n<p><strong>Large (more than 12,500 students)</strong><br /> Cedar Valley College &ndash;
