= STARS Web Application README =

== Installation ==

To develop on the STARS application locally, the only requirement is that you have Python 2.4+ installed. 2.6 is recommended, because this is what's running on the server.

To get your buildout environment set up run the bootstrap.py file:
$ python bootstrap.py

You should now run buildout to install the necessary dependencies:
$ ./bin/buildout

That's it! Your environment will be set up with local copies of:
 - Django 1.1.1
 - South 0.6.2
 - Fabric 0.9.0
 - TinyMCE 3.3 (javascript library)

When you want to run any of the standard Django commands, use bin/django instead of manage.py:
$ ./bin/django runserver

=== Note about South ===

If you have an existing version of the db already, you'll need to run sycndb to get integrate south:
$ ./bin/django sycndb

More information: http://south.aeracode.org/

== Settings ==

STARS can be deployed in a variety of environments. `settings.py` is used in test environments that don't use mod_python. To add another test environment add another item to the dictionary. The dictionary accepts regular expressions.

configs = {
    '/Users/jamstooks/aashe/STARS/src/.*/stars': 'ben',
}

=== Local ===

STARS matches the dictionary key with the directory `settings.py` is being executed from and uses the value to load the configuration file. In this case it loads `config/ben.py` to get the settings for my environment. You should create your own custom settings file in the `config/` directory if you want to do any testing.
You will need to set up a MEDIA_ROOT directory locally, and set the path in your personal config.  
The MEDIA_ROOT folder should have the following structure:
  admin/  # a symbolic link to /django/contrib/admin/media in your Django install.
  tp/
     js/  # a directory for third-party scripts
          # tinyMCE is pulled down with buildout
          
=== Server ===
