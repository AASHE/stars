= STARS Web Application README =

This document assumes you have checked out the latest source code to get this file...

== Installation ==

See README_VENV for setting up your local working environment

=== Note about South ===

If you have an existing version of the db already, you'll need to run sycndb to get integrate south:
>$ ./bin/django sycndb

More information: http://south.aeracode.org/

== Settings ==

The default configuration file should work right out of the box:

stars/config/default.py

This configuration will use (and create) a sqlite3 db and media directory in your home directory.

=== Personal Settings ===

STARS can be deployed in a variety of environments. You may want to create your own personal configuration file according to your needs. You can do this easily by copying the default config file and adding another test environment item to the dictionary in stars/settings.py. The dictionary accepts regular expressions, for example:

configs = {
    '/Users/jamstooks/.*': 'ben',
}

=== TinyMCE (WYSIWYG Editor) ===

If you want to use the TinyMCE editor in your development, you will need to create a symlink in your media directory:

~/stars_media/tp/js/tiny_mce -> PATH_TO_SRC/stars/parts/tinyMCE/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce

TinyMCE is automatically pulled down by buildout.

== Quick STARS (I mean START) ==

...from the package directory

>$ python manage.py django syncdb    # This initializes the DB
>$ python manage.py runserver # Runs the server on http://localhost:8000/
          
=== Deployment ===
