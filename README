== Installation ==

STARS can be deployed in a variety of environments. `settings.py` is used in test environments that don't use mod_python. To add another test environment add another item to the dictionary:

configs = {
    '/Users/jamstooks/aashe/STARS/src/stars': 'ben',
}

STARS matches the dictionary key with the directory `settings.py` is being executed from and uses the value to load the configuration file. In this case it loads `config/ben.py` to get the settings for my environment. You should create your own custom settings file in the `config/` directory if you want to do any testing.
You will need to set up a MEDIA_ROOT directory locally, and set the path in your personal config.  
The MEDIA_ROOT folder should have the following structure:
  admin/  # a symbolic link to /django/contrib/admin/media in your Django install.
  static/ # a symbolic link to /stars/static in your STARS source
  tp/
     js/  # a directory for third-party scripts
          # you can download these scripts from /var/www/vhosts/dev.aashe.org/subdomains/stars/httpdocs/media/tp/ on aashe server.

In a mod_python environment the 'vhost.conf' file will explicitly define the settings file to use and will bypass `settings.py` altogether. Here is an example from our development server:

SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE stars.config.development
