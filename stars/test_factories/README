test_factories is a package of factories used by some of the STARS
tests.  They used to live under apps.tool.manage.tests, but now they
live up here so they can be shared by other STARS apps.

The factories use the factory_boy package
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=factory_boy&submit=search).

Is stars/test_factories the right place for them?  I don't know.
They're not an app, so stars/apps/test_factories didn't seem right.
If you think they belong elsewhere, feel free to move them -- and then
remember to update the imports in the tests that 'from
stars.test_factories import ...'.
