Dear {{ submissionset.institution.contact_first_name }} {{ submissionset.institution.contact_last_name }},

Congratulations on finalizing your Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) Report and submitting your STARS data. This is a significant accomplishment! 

Although STARS is a program of AASHE, we would like to remind you that, since STARS is a self-assessment. AASHE does not certify or award STARS Ratings to institutions.  Institutions achieve a STARS Rating by successfully completing a STARS submission and earning a Rating based on the number of points attained within the STARS credits. 

Compiling this information is a huge achievement and one that we hope will help {{ submissionset.institution }} become more sustainable. Your STARS data and ranking will be publicly posted on our website shortly, once your submission has been fully processed.

Congratulations on a job well done,

The STARS Team
