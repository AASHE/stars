<p>
  Dear {{ institution.contact_first_name }} {{institution.contact_last_name }},
</p>

<p>
  Congratulations on finalizing your institution's STARS report!
  AASHE staff review one-third of credits in all finalized STARS
  reports to ensure that credit criteria and intent are being
  satisfied, while also working with institutions to improve quality
  of current and future reports. This is the final step before
  awarding your institution’s STARS rating and publishing the report
  on the STARS website.
</p>

{% if best_practices %}
  <p>
    We made note of a reporting best practice
    in the following area(s):
    <ul>
      {% for best_practice in best_practices %}
        <li>
          <a href="https://stars.aashe.org{{ best_practice.credit_user_submission.get_submit_url }}">
            {{ best_practice.credit_user_submission.credit }}</a>: {{ best_practice.comment }}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </p>
{% endif %}

{% if revision_requests %}
  <p>
    According to our review, the descriptions of areas not matching
    credit criteria and intent are listed below. Our goal is to have any
    inconsistencies reviewed and revised as soon as possible and within
    60 days from today. The credit(s) listed below have been unlocked
    for editing in the
    <a href="https://stars.aashe.org{{ my_submission_url }}">
      My Submission</a>
    section of the Reporting Tool. Once all inconsistencies are
    addressed, your institution’s report will go public and we will
    forward a certificate of rating to the STARS Liaison, Executive
    Contact and President/Chancellor. Included in the review results
    below are credit URLs and Technical Manual links for your reference:
    <ul>
      {% for revision_request in revision_requests %}
        <li>
          <a href="https://stars.aashe.org{{ revision_request.credit_user_submission.get_submit_url }}">
            {{ revision_request.credit_user_submission.credit }}</a>: {{ revision_request.comment }}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </p>
{% endif %}

{% if suggestions_for_improvement %}
  <p>
    Below are areas where credit intent was satisfied, but AASHE
    staff identified one or more suggestions for improvement. The
    credit(s) listed below have also been unlocked for editing in the
    <a href="https://stars.aashe.org{{ my_submission_url }}">
      My Submission</a>
    section of the Reporting Tool, and we encourage you to make the
    suggested changes. The issue(s) below do not have to be addressed
    in order to receive your rating and certificate:
    <ul>
      {% for suggestion_for_improvement in suggestions_for_improvement %}
        <li>
          <a href="https://stars.aashe.org{{ suggestion_for_improvement.credit_user_submission.get_submit_url }}">
            {{ suggestion_for_improvement.credit_user_submission.credit }}</a>: {{ suggestion_for_improvement.comment }}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </p>
{% endif %}
