            <h2>Executive-level Administrator Contact Information</h2>
            <p>Since STARS covers the activities of many campus departments and requires the involvement of many individuals, it’s important that your institution’s participation has high-level support.  Please provide the contact information for one executive (President, Chancellor, Vice President, Vice Chancellor, or Provost) for AASHE  to copy on the registration confirmation e-mail.  This executive will not be included in subsequent communication and his or her contact information will not be otherwise used.  You may wish to send a message to this person so they know to expect the e-mail from AASHE.   
                </p><p>
            Please note that after all data have been submitted, a letter from the President or Chancellor will be required to earn a STARS rating.</p>
