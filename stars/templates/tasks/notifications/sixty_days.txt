Dear {{ ss.institution.contact_first_name }} {{ ss.institution.contact_last_name }},

This is a friendly reminder that there are only 60 days remaining until your STARS submission deadline.  If you haven't already done so, we highly recommend that you log into the STARS Reporting Tool to get started.

If you will be unable to complete your STARS Report by the submission deadline, you may apply for a six-month extension prior to the deadline.  To apply for a six-month extension, please use the "Submission Sets" tab under "Manage Institution" in the Reporting Tool and click on the "Extend Deadline" button.

If you have any questions please contact stars@aashe.org.

We look forward to your continued participation in STARS.
