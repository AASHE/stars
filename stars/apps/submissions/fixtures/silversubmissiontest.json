This was the first rating system developed by USGBC and is the most popular design and construction certification for colleges and universities.&nbsp; The U.S. Green Building Council describes &ldquo;When to Use LEED for New Construction&rdquo; as follows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for New Construction was designed primarily for new commercial office buildings, but it has been applied to many other building types by LEED practitioners. All commercial buildings, as defined by standard building codes, are eligible for certification as LEED for New Construction buildings. Examples of commercial occupancies include offices, institutional buildings (libraries, museums, churches, etc.), hotels, and residential buildings of 4 or more habitable stories.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for New Construction addresses design and construction activities for both new buildings and major renovations of existing buildings. A major renovation involves major HVAC renovation, significant envelope modifications, and major interior rehabilitation. For a major renovation of an existing building, LEED for New Construction is the appropriate rating system. If the project scope does not involve significant design and construction activities and focuses more on operations and maintenance activities, LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance is more appropriate because it addresses operational and maintenance issues of working buildings.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Some projects are designed and constructed to be partially occupied by the owner or developer, and partially occupied by others tenants. In such projects, the owner or developer has direct influence over the portion of the work that they occupy. For such a project to pursue LEED for New Construction certification, the owner or tenant must occupy more than 50% of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage. Projects in which 50% or less of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage is occupied by an owner should pursue LEED for Core &amp; Shell certification.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=145\" target=\"_blank\">LEED for Commercial Interiors</a></strong> is a green building design and construction rating system for tenant improvement projects.&nbsp; The U.S. Green Building Council describes &ldquo;When to Use LEED for Commercial Interiors&rdquo;:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for Commercial Interiors addresses the specifics of tenant spaces primarily in office, retail, and institutional buildings.

The LEED for Core &amp; Shell Rating System acknowledges the limited level of influence a developer can exert in a speculatively developed building.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for Core &amp; Shell was developed to serve the speculative development market, in which project teams do not control all scopes of a whole building&rsquo;s design and construction. Depending on how the project is structured, this scope can vary significantly from project to project. The LEED for Core &amp; Shell Rating System addresses a variety of project types and a broad project range.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for Core &amp; Shell can be used for projects in which the developer controls the design and construction of the entire core and shell base building (e.g., mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection systems) but has no control over the design and construction of the tenant fit-out. Examples of this type of project can be a commercial office building, medical office building, retail center, warehouse, and lab facility.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>If a project is designed and constructed to be partially occupied by the owner or developer, then the owner or developer has direct influence over that portion of the interior build-out work. For these projects to pursue LEED for Core &amp; Shell certification, the owner must occupy 50% or less of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage.

(These attributes include the tons of greenhouse gas that were avoided by generating electricity from renewable resources instead of conventional fuels, such as coal, nuclear, oil, or gas.) These renewable (&ldquo;green&rdquo;) attributes are sold separately as renewable energy certificates (RECs). One REC is issued for each megawatt-hour (MWh) unit of renewable electricity produced. The electricity that was split from the REC is no longer considered \"renewable\" and cannot be counted as renewable or zero-emissions by whoever buys it.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>RECs contain specific information about the renewable energy generated, including where, when, at what facility, and with what type of generation.

Sighting a single pest does not always mean control is needed. The level at which pests will become an economic threat is critical to guide future pest control decisions.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Monitor and Identify Pests &ndash; </em></strong><em>Not all insects, weeds, and other living organisms require control. Many organisms are innocuous, and some are even beneficial. IPM programs work to monitor for pests and identify them accurately, so that appropriate control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds. This monitoring and identification removes the possibility that pesticides will be used when they are not really needed or that the wrong kind of pesticide will be used.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Prevention</em></strong><em> &ndash; As&nbsp; a first line of pest control, IPM programs work to manage the crop, lawn, or indoor space to prevent pests from becoming a threat. In an agricultural crop, this may mean using cultural methods, such as rotating between different crops, selecting pest-resistant varieties, and planting pest-free rootstock. These control methods can be very effective and cost-efficient and present little to no risk to people or the environment.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Control</em></strong><em> &ndash; Once monitoring, identification, and action thresholds indicate that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer effective or available, IPM programs then evaluate the proper control method both for effectiveness and risk. Effective, less risky pest controls are chosen first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. If further monitoring, identifications and action thresholds indicate that less risky controls are not working, then additional pest control methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last resort.</em></p>", "last_choice_is_other": false, "min_range": 0, "credit": 40, "inline_help_text": "", "tabular_fields": null, "units": 6, "identifier": "B", "type": "numeric", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 295, "model": "credits.documentationfield", "fields": {"ordinal": 2, "max_range": null, "required": "req", "previous_version": null, "title": "A brief description of the IPM plan(s) ", "tooltip_help_text": "", "last_choice_is_other": false, "min_range": null, "credit": 40, "inline_help_text": "", "tabular_fields": null, "units": null, "identifier": "C", "type": "long_text", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 296, "model": "credits.documentationfield", "fields": {"ordinal": 3, "max_range": null, "required": "opt", "previous_version": null, "title": "The website URL where information about the IPM plan(s) is available", "tooltip_help_text": "", "last_choice_is_other": false, "min_range": null, "credit": 40, "inline_help_text": "", "tabular_fields": null, "units": null, "identifier": "D", "type": "url", "is_published": true}},

Our Sustainability Steering Committee agreed to this policy:  In accordance with the college\u2019s strategic plan and the mission of the Sustainability Steering Committee, Agnes Scott is committed to reduce, reuse, recycle and rethink.  Specifically, the college staff, faculty, and students will participate in an aggressive waste reduction program that includes, but is not limited to, single-stream recycling, ink cartridge and electronics recycling, used cooking oil reuse, as well as paper reduction initiatives.  \r\n\r\nWith a 2011 diversion rate of 73%, Agnes Scott College is on its way to achieving its zero waste goals. The college implemented a campus wide, single-stream recycling program in 2008.  The following year, we began composting in our dining hall and first-year residence halls. Selecting waste reduction and diversion as our first major program has yielded important results with no budget increases.  In addition, every member of the campus community has been directly involved as this has become a natural part of college life. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve decided to change our recycling hauling company in order to receive rebates. Because of the switch, we were able to compact our recyclables, a process which not only increases our capacity and overall output, but helps reduce our contamination problems. In addition, we have an area to hold scrap metal and a successful electronics recycling program. All of these have made it possible to reduce our trash hauls and overall tons sent to the landfill. We know these efforts are a daily practice, and we\u2019re excited by the support and enthusiasm from the campus community.\r\n", "credit_submission": 23862}},

{"pk": 31498, "model": "submissions.longtextsubmission", "fields": {"documentation_field": 700, "value": "In early 2011 Agnes Scott College agreed to participate in a project entitled \u201cAdvancing Residential Energy Retrofits\u201d with Southface and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to develop deep energy retrofit case studies for single-family homes in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The results of this case study would help gain a stronger understanding of the impact of various retrofit measures on energy efficiency and cost savings in this mixed humid climate zone. The approach for this project was to incorporate integrated building science and systems engineering principles to provide technical assistance for deep energy retrofits and understand the related health, safety, comfort and durability needs. Agnes Scott selected five homes from its inventory of properties located adjacent to campus. These homes are occupied by Agnes Scott College faculty and staff members and their families. All of the homes selected for the project were built in the early 1920s.\r\n\r\nThe project process involved Southface and ORNL first evaluating pre-retrofit levels of energy use by performing whole-house assessments and analyzing utility bills.  During the pre-retrofit stage each house was outfitted with a monitoring system to collect energy and comfort data during and after construction. Using the information collected about current home energy use, they developed detailed recommendations for implementation that would result in energy savings between 30 and 50 percent. Southface and ORNL then shared their recommendations with Agnes Scott\u2019s selected contractor Renewal Systems Solutions and representatives from Agnes Scott\u2019s Office of Facilies, Office of Business and Finance, and Office of Sustainability. The project team met for a day long charrette to discuss the recommendations for each house and determine the best course of action for each one. Once a project plan was completed and approved work began on the homes in late summer 2010.\r\n\r\nThe contractor first addressed any health or safety issues which included solving problems with mold, water intrusion, and wood rot. The energy efficiency measure for each home included air sealing attics and crawlspaces, adding insulation and weather-stripping, installing new furnace and air conditioning units, repairing or installing ductwork, and installing heat pump water heater. \r\n\r\nAfter the retrofits were completed final whole-house assessments were performed on each house to provide quality assurance and collect data to compare to pre-improvement data. Each of the homes that participated in the project now uses between 30 and 50 percent less energy. For the residents this means homes that are more comfortable, healthy, and affordable. In addition to the energy retrofit work each of these homes also received roofing repairs and new exterior paint which helps to contribute to the aesthetic of the surrounding community. For Agnes Scott College this project helped to serve as a model for future retrofit and construction projects to its remaining stock of homes. All future projects will have an eye toward building science and carefully thought out solutions to issues affecting a home\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nThis project has also allowed Agnes Scott to build strong relationships will all parties involved in the project including Southface, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the City of Decatur, Georgia Power, and Renewal Systems Solutions. This project gave members of Agnes Scott\u2019s staff an excellent opportunity to work collaboratively. Because of their work on this project, the Offices of Sustainability, Facilities, and Business & Finance were selcted as a team to receive the \"Promise Award for Breaking Down Silos\" presented by Agnes Scott College at the annual faculty and staff Holiday Party.\r\n", "credit_submission": 23916}}, {"pk": 2234, "model": "submissions.uploadsubmission", "fields": {"documentation_field": 701, "value": "secure/286/2/140/701/STARS_Letter.pdf", "credit_submission": 23916}}, {"pk": 24418, "model": "submissions.urlsubmission", "fields": {"documentation_field": 702, "value": "", "credit_submission": 23916}},

The guide loosely tied together a few of the college\u2019s 2,000+ trees with institutional history and native species significance. The Agnes Scott Arboretum originated as a project to update the tree guide of 1995, which included a pamphlet with scientific names, pictures, and descriptions of 20 trees included on the walk. Instead the Arboretum became an interdisciplinary team project with a whole new way of looking at the college's tree canopy.  There are 17 locations in the Arboretum, with more than 40 trees are represented in the descriptions. Some of the topics covered in the location interpretations include: the history of trees, trees as carbon sinks, the importance of trees to alumnae and of alumnae to the college, how trees improve the quality of water, trees used in medicine, the succession of trees in a forest, native trees, how trees instill a sense of mindfulness, and trees in industry. The Arboretum Project\u2019s goal is to involve the campus and surrounding community by encouraging interaction with the trees and canopy. Instead of a backdrop, the trees are the main focus.\r\nThe Arboretum Team includes 5 faculty, 3 staff members, and 1 student. The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) has helped tremendously in the creation of the Arboretum. A student intern in the Office of Sustainability wrote and received a grant and fellowship from the NWF on the proposed project of the Arboretum. This fellowship is a yearly commitment and has allowed for the college to focus its efforts on the completion of this interdisciplinary project.\r\nThe Arboretum guide will be based on QR codes instead of a paper map or pamphlet. By using a website and a proxy that can be accessed by mobile devices, we are providing our audience with the ability to dynamically learn about the trees that shape our lives. Instead of using a pamphlet or map that will become stagnant, the websites will be continuously updated, and will act as a medium to help our community interact with nature and to rethink locations that they may pass by everyday. The website will house audio with snippets from past Alumnae, influential professors and staff, and donors to the Sustainability initiatives on campus. The audio will accompany descriptions of each individual location while providing a connection to trees\u2019 the cultural, historical and ecological significance.\r\nAlong with the creation of the Arboretum, we have drafted Agnes Scott\u2019s Tree Care Plan in order to apply for Tree Campus USA. This will also be uploaded onto our website so that the community is aware of our commitment to keep our tree canopy healthy, replenished and growing. We have set a goal to have a net gain of trees. Whenever a tree is removed, we will replace that tree and plant another one with similar projected canopy coverage on campus. We will now be establishing a permanent Tree Committee not only to make sure the Tree Care Plan is adhered to, but also to allow us to give the committee the responsibility of managing the future of the Arboretum project itself.", "credit_submission": 23917}}, {"pk": 5146, "model": "submissions.uploadsubmission", "fields": {"documentation_field": 713, "value": "secure/286/2/141/713/STARS innovation credit affirmation letter.pdf", "credit_submission": 23917}}, {"pk": 54363, "model": "submissions.urlsubmission", "fields": {"documentation_field": 714, "value": "http://ascarboretum.blogspot.com/", "credit_submission": 23917}},

Like Agnes Scott, Decatur is a smaller institution. The city is 4 square miles, has 18,000 residents and is very committed to sustainability. Because of this commitment, it was only natural that the city\u2019s sustainability program would support and influence Agnes Scott\u2019s efforts. Additionally, both institutions successfully model a concept that small can be sustainable, particularly because they are able to foster such successful partnerships. \r\n\r\nOur partnership is unique, particularly because of how closely we work together. Several city employees were very influential during the charrette that created the structure for Agnes Scott\u2019s Office of Sustainability and its subsequent goals. Their input was crucial at the college\u2019s beginning stages, particularly because a partnership with the city was a top priority for Agnes Scott\u2019s sustainability efforts. It was and is important for the college to know what the city has planned for sustainability because there are many opportunities for partnerships, collaborations or general support.\r\n\r\nOne such example is Agnes Scott\u2019s Sustainability Fellow program. The two-year, post-undergraduate position employs a recent ASC graduate to work in the Office of Sustainability in various capacities. The fellow works with students on education and outreach, helps to manage the zero waste program, and functions in the office in various capacities. The city of Decatur partially funded the fellow program from its inception. Because of the continued partnership and funding, the fellow acts as a liaison to the city in its sustainability efforts. In particular, the fellow attends Environmental Sustainability Board meetings as representative of the college, and is afforded numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth through small projects for the city. The two Sustainability Fellows have partnered with Decatur on several important projects, including:  completing a waste audit, drafting the city\u2019s first sustainability plan, completing some data input tasks, and drafting guidelines for a sustainable restaurant program. The fellows have greatly benefitted from the professional opportunities as well.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2011, Agnes Scott began a project to weatherize and renovate five residential homes it owns. The college found technical assistance through Southface Energy Institute Oak Ridge National Lab and some financial incentives through rebates from Decatur. The college\u2019s partnership with the city made it possible to learn about and apply for the funding, and opened the door for future opportunities.\r\n\r\nEven smaller opportunities for collaboration are important. For example, Agnes Scott allows a community garden funded and promoted by the city to use the college\u2019s greenhouse to seed spring crops. A representative from Agnes Scott\u2019s Office of Sustainability also attends Decatur Agriculture Initiative meetings, which help the direct and inform the city\u2019s decisions about urban farms, community gardens and future food sources. Additionally, both institutions have found capacities for volunteering or providing volunteers. For example, the college provides student, staff and faculty volunteers for the city\u2019s volunteer efforts for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. For the past decade, Decatur\u2019s MLK Day volunteer efforts have been to help senior citizens weatherize their homes. \r\n\r\nThe partnership\u2019s greatest benefit is the ability to keep both institutions \u201cin the know\u201d on their sustainability efforts. Because both organizations are so small in comparison to their peers, partnerships are key to achieving real success in sustainability. Even if no collaboration comes of a particular meeting or shared opportunity, the continued efforts to cooperate is what makes the partnership on sustainability between Agnes Scott and Decatur so successful.", "credit_submission": 23919}}, {"pk": 5408, "model": "submissions.uploadsubmission", "fields": {"documentation_field": 719, "value": "secure/286/2/143/719/CoD Amanda Thompson Letter.pdf", "credit_submission": 23919}}, {"pk": 56958, "model": "submissions.urlsubmission", "fields": {"documentation_field": 720, "value": "", "credit_submission": 23919}},
