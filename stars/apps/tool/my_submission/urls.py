# Here's an illustration of the problem with caching
# CreditSubmissionReportingFieldsView, noted above.
#
#   1. Institution.prefers_metric_system is False, so
#      fields that have a related measurement unit display
#      the US versions, e.g., `acres` and `gallons`, not
#      `hectares` and `cubic metres`.
#   2. User pulls up credit submission page with fields labelled `acres`.
#   3. User goes to Settings and sets Institution.prefers_metric_system
#      to True.
#   4. User goes back to same credit submission page, but rather than
#      `hectares`, the field noted above is still labelled `acres`,
#      *and the quantity has not been converted to metric*.  At this point,
#      if the user simply saves the form, his data is corrupted, since
#      the US quantity is submitted, but the backend thinks it's a metric
#      quantity, since Institution.prefers_metric_system is True.  Since
#      it's a metric quantity, it's converted to its US equivalent and
#      this is stored in the database.
