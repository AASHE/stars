Since a STARS Report for your institution was not submitted within the given time frame to complete the Report, your institution no longer has access to the STARS Reporting Tool or any of the data stored there.  In order to gain access to the system, and continue to be recognized as a STARS Charter Participant, you need to renew your institution\u2019s participation in STARS. Renewing your participation will cost $[AMOUNT]. This is a 50% discount from the regular registration prices as we hope to encourage institutions to participate annually. This discount will is only valid for 90 days after your submission deadline of [DATE].\r\n\r\nWe encourage your institution to renew its participation with STARS and remain active with the STARS Program. Please let us know as soon as possible about your plans for participating in STARS. If we have not heard from you within 30 days, your institution will no longer be recognized as a STARS Charter Participant and will be removed from our website (and all public recognition by AASHE) until you renew with the program.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be helpful to understand why you were unable to complete your submission. This will help us identify ways to better support STARS Participants moving forward. Please let us know and feel free to email any feedback or questions to stars@aashe.org or call (859) 309-6755.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJillian, on behalf of the STARS Team",
