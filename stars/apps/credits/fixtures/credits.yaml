            \ plans or policies or in the context of other reporting obligations&nbsp;</li>\r\
            \n</ul>\r\n<p>Recommended best practices for defining a baseline include:&nbsp;</p>\r\

            \ multiple credits to reduce reporting requirements. For example, institutions\
            \ using 2005 for all STARS credits that are baseline-based would only\
            \ have to calculate baseline weighted campus user data once.&nbsp;</li>\r\
            \n<li>Ensuring that baseline and performance year data are valid and reliable\
            \ (e.g. that the data were gathered in the same manner)&nbsp;</li>\r\n\
            </ul>\r\n<p>Institutions without valid and reliable historical data should\
            \ use performance year data for both the baseline and performance year.\
            \ Following this approach, an institution would not be able to claim points\
            \ during its first STARS submission, but would be able to use its newly\
            \ established baseline for subsequent submissions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Institutions\

            \ 3-year period that most closely overlaps with the building energy consumption\
            \ baseline period). Institutions may use average building space from throughout\
            \ the period or a snapshot at a single representative point during the\
            \ period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Sampling and Data Standards</h3>\r\n<p class=\"\

            \ than source energy (the amount of energy consumed on campus plus the\
            \ energy used off-site to generate and transport the energy to the institution).\

            \ credit for Greening Laboratories. Listing a series of unrelated accomplishments\
            \ or events under a single innovation credit is not accepted.</li>\r\n\
            <li>While the practices that led to receiving an award may be appropriate\
            \ for an innovation credit, winning awards and/or high sustainability\
            \ rankings in other assessments is not, in and of itself, grounds for\
            \ an innovation credit. When the&nbsp;innovation is part of a partnership,\
            \ the summary provided must clearly describe the institution&rsquo;s role\
            \ in the innovation.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>To help ensure that the policy,\
            \ practice, program, or outcome that the institution is claiming for an\
            \ innovation credit is truly innovative, institutions must submit a letter\
            \ of affirmation from an individual with relevant expertise in the associated\
            \ content area. The letter should affirm how the innovation meets the\
            \ criteria outlined above.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if an institution claims\
            \ an innovation credit for water use reduction, the institution might\
            \ solicit a letter from a hydrologist or a water expert from another campus\
            \ or organization to verify that the strategy is innovative. An innovation\
            \ may be affirmed internally by campus personnel who are independent of\
            \ the policy, practice, program, or outcome. Please note that it is not\
            \ required that the individual be employed in the higher education sector\
            \ to submit a letter of verification.</p>\r\n<p>The letter should be specific\
            \ to a single innovation credit. If an institution is claiming three innovation\
            \ credits, it would solicit and submit three separate letters, with each\

            \n<p>Option 5:&nbsp; Using cogeneration technologies to generate electricity\
            \ more efficiently.&nbsp; Note: generating electricity using cogeneration\
            \ technology and a renewable fuel, such as biomass, is considered Option\
            \ 1 and should not be counted twice.</p>\r\n<p>Since this credit is intended\

            \ within the three years prior to the anticipated date of submission.</li>\r\
            \n<li>The innovative practice or program has to be something that the\
            \ institution has already done; planned activities do not count.</li>\r\
            \n<li>The innovative practice or program should originate from an area\
            \ within the defined institutional boundary.</li>\r\n<li>An institution\
            \ can only claim a particular activity as an innovation credit once. When\

            \ submitted previously cannot be re-submitted. An institution that has\
            \ made significant advancements to a project or program that was previously\
            \ submitted as an innovation may resubmit based on those advancements\
            \ if the project or program is still considered innovative.</li>\r\n<li>Practices,\
            \ policies, and programs that were once considered innovative but are\
            \ now widely adopted (e.g. being the first institution to enact a policy\
            \ 20 years ago that is now common) may not be claimed as innovation credits.</li>\r\
            \n<li>Multiple activities or practices whose sum is innovative can be\
            \ considered for an innovation credit as long as those activities or practices\
            \ are related. For example, three innovative waste reduction programs\
            \ in research laboratories could be listed together under a single innovation\
            \ credit for Greening Laboratories. Listing a series of unrelated accomplishments\
            \ or events under a single innovation credit is not accepted.</li>\r\n\
            <li>While the practices that led to receiving an award may be appropriate\
            \ for an innovation credit, winning awards and/or high sustainability\
            \ rankings in other assessments is not, in and of itself, grounds for\

            \ innovation credit is truly innovative, institutions must submit a letter\
            \ of affirmation from an individual with relevant expertise in the associated\
            \ content area. The letter should affirm how the innovation meets the\
            \ criteria outlined above.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if an institution claims\
            \ an innovation credit for water use reduction, the institution might\
            \ solicit a letter from a hydrologist or a water expert from another campus\
            \ or organization to verify that the strategy is innovative. An innovation\
            \ may be affirmed internally by campus personnel who are independent of\
            \ the policy, practice, program, or outcome. Please note that it is not\
            \ required that the individual be employed in the higher education sector\
            \ to submit a letter of verification.</p>\r\n<p>The letter should be specific\

            \ as follows</a>:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Set Action Thresholds</em></strong><em>\
            \ &ndash; Before taking any pest control action, IPM first sets an action\
            \ threshold, a point at which pest populations or environmental conditions\
            \ indicate that pest control action must be taken. Sighting a single pest\
            \ does not always mean control is needed. The level at which pests will\
            \ become an economic threat is critical to guide future pest control decisions.</em></p>\r\
            \n<p><strong><em>Monitor and Identify Pests &ndash; </em></strong><em>Not\
            \ all insects, weeds, and other living organisms require control. Many\
            \ organisms are innocuous, and some are even beneficial. IPM programs\
            \ work to monitor for pests and identify them accurately, so that appropriate\
            \ control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds.\
            \ This monitoring and identification removes the possibility that pesticides\
            \ will be used when they are not really needed or that the wrong kind\
            \ of pesticide will be used.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Prevention</em></strong><em>\
            \ &ndash; As&nbsp; a first line of pest control, IPM programs work to\
            \ manage the crop, lawn, or indoor space to prevent pests from becoming\
            \ a threat. In an agricultural crop, this may mean using cultural methods,\
            \ such as rotating between different crops, selecting pest-resistant varieties,\
            \ and planting pest-free rootstock. These control methods can be very\
            \ effective and cost-efficient and present little to no risk to people\
            \ or the environment.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Control</em></strong><em>\
            \ &ndash; Once monitoring, identification, and action thresholds indicate\
            \ that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer\
            \ effective or available, IPM programs then evaluate the proper control\
            \ method both for effectiveness and risk. Effective, less risky pest controls\
            \ are chosen first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones\
            \ to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding.\
            \ If further monitoring, identifications and action thresholds indicate\
            \ that less risky controls are not working, then additional pest control\
            \ methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides.\
            \ Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last resort.</em></p>",

            \ as follows</a>:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Set Action Thresholds</em></strong><em>\
            \ &ndash; Before taking any pest control action, IPM first sets an action\
            \ threshold, a point at which pest populations or environmental conditions\
            \ indicate that pest control action must be taken. Sighting a single pest\
            \ does not always mean control is needed. The level at which pests will\
            \ become an economic threat is critical to guide future pest control decisions.</em></p>\r\
            \n<p><strong><em>Monitor and Identify Pests &ndash; </em></strong><em>Not\
            \ all insects, weeds, and other living organisms require control. Many\
            \ organisms are innocuous, and some are even beneficial. IPM programs\
            \ work to monitor for pests and identify them accurately, so that appropriate\
            \ control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds.\
            \ This monitoring and identification removes the possibility that pesticides\
            \ will be used when they are not really needed or that the wrong kind\
            \ of pesticide will be used.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Prevention</em></strong><em>\
            \ &ndash; As&nbsp; a first line of pest control, IPM programs work to\
            \ manage the crop, lawn, or indoor space to prevent pests from becoming\
            \ a threat. In an agricultural crop, this may mean using cultural methods,\
            \ such as rotating between different crops, selecting pest-resistant varieties,\
            \ and planting pest-free rootstock. These control methods can be very\
            \ effective and cost-efficient and present little to no risk to people\
            \ or the environment.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Control</em></strong><em>\
            \ &ndash; Once monitoring, identification, and action thresholds indicate\
            \ that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer\
            \ effective or available, IPM programs then evaluate the proper control\
            \ method both for effectiveness and risk. Effective, less risky pest controls\
            \ are chosen first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones\
            \ to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding.\
            \ If further monitoring, identifications and action thresholds indicate\
            \ that less risky controls are not working, then additional pest control\
            \ methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides.\
            \ Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last resort.</em></p>",

            \ target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;four-tiered approach to integrated pest management\
            \ as follows</a>:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Set Action Thresholds</em></strong><em>\
            \ &ndash; Before taking any pest control action, IPM first sets an action\
            \ threshold, a point at which pest populations or environmental conditions\
            \ indicate that pest control action must be taken. Sighting a single pest\
            \ does not always mean control is needed. The level at which pests will\
            \ become an economic threat is critical to guide future pest control decisions.</em></p>\r\
            \n<p><strong><em>Monitor and Identify Pests &ndash; </em></strong><em>Not\
            \ all insects, weeds, and other living organisms require control. Many\
            \ organisms are innocuous, and some are even beneficial. IPM programs\
            \ work to monitor for pests and identify them accurately, so that appropriate\
            \ control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds.\
            \ This monitoring and identification removes the possibility that pesticides\
            \ will be used when they are not really needed or that the wrong kind\
            \ of pesticide will be used.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Prevention</em></strong><em>\
            \ &ndash; As&nbsp; a first line of pest control, IPM programs work to\
            \ manage the crop, lawn, or indoor space to prevent pests from becoming\
            \ a threat. In an agricultural crop, this may mean using cultural methods,\
            \ such as rotating between different crops, selecting pest-resistant varieties,\
            \ and planting pest-free rootstock. These control methods can be very\
            \ effective and cost-efficient and present little to no risk to people\
            \ or the environment.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Control</em></strong><em>\
            \ &ndash; Once monitoring, identification, and action thresholds indicate\
            \ that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer\
            \ effective or available, IPM programs then evaluate the proper control\
            \ method both for effectiveness and risk. Effective, less risky pest controls\
            \ are chosen first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones\
            \ to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding.\
            \ If further monitoring, identifications and action thresholds indicate\
            \ that less risky controls are not working, then additional pest control\
            \ methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides.\
            \ Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last resort.</em></p>",

            \ U.S. Green Building Council describes &ldquo;When to Use LEED for New\
            \ Construction&rdquo; as follows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for New Construction\
            \ was designed primarily for new commercial office buildings, but it has\
            \ been applied to many other building types by LEED practitioners. All\
            \ commercial buildings, as defined by standard building codes, are eligible\
            \ for certification as LEED for New Construction buildings. Examples of\
            \ commercial occupancies include offices, institutional buildings (libraries,\
            \ museums, churches, etc.), hotels, and residential buildings of 4 or\
            \ more habitable stories.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for New Construction\
            \ addresses design and construction activities for both new buildings\
            \ and major renovations of existing buildings. A major renovation involves\
            \ major HVAC renovation, significant envelope modifications, and major\
            \ interior rehabilitation. For a major renovation of an existing building,\
            \ LEED for New Construction is the appropriate rating system. If the project\
            \ scope does not involve significant design and construction activities\
            \ and focuses more on operations and maintenance activities, LEED for\
            \ Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance is more appropriate\
            \ because it addresses operational and maintenance issues of working buildings.</em></p>\r\
            \n<p><em>Some projects are designed and constructed to be partially occupied\
            \ by the owner or developer, and partially occupied by others tenants.\
            \ In such projects, the owner or developer has direct influence over the\
            \ portion of the work that they occupy. For such a project to pursue LEED\

            \ more than 50% of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage. Projects\
            \ in which 50% or less of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage\

            \ building (e.g., mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection\
            \ systems) but has no control over the design and construction of the\

            \ footage. Projects in which more than 50% of the building&rsquo;s tenant\

            \ All commercial buildings, as defined by standard building codes, are\
            \ eligible for certification as LEED for New Construction buildings. Examples\
            \ of commercial occupancies include offices, institutional buildings (libraries,\
            \ museums, churches, etc.), hotels, and residential buildings of 4 or\
            \ more habitable stories.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for New Construction\
            \ addresses design and construction activities for both new buildings\
            \ and major renovations of existing buildings. A major renovation involves\
            \ major HVAC renovation, significant envelope modifications, and major\
            \ interior rehabilitation. For a major renovation of an existing building,\
            \ LEED for New Construction is the appropriate rating system. If the project\
            \ scope does not involve significant design and construction activities\
            \ and focuses more on operations and maintenance activities, LEED for\
            \ Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance is more appropriate\
            \ because it addresses operational and maintenance issues of working buildings.</em></p>\r\
            \n<p><em>Some projects are designed and constructed to be partially occupied\
            \ by the owner or developer, and partially occupied by others tenants.\
            \ In such projects, the owner or developer has direct influence over the\
            \ portion of the work that they occupy. For such a project to pursue LEED\

            \ variety of project types and a broad project range.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED\
            \ for Core &amp; Shell can be used for projects in which the developer\

            \ building (e.g., mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection\
            \ systems) but has no control over the design and construction of the\

            \ is a design and construction green building rating system.&nbsp; This\
            \ was the first rating system developed by USGBC and is the most popular\
            \ design and construction certification for colleges and universities.&nbsp;\
            \ The U.S. Green Building Council describes &ldquo;When to Use LEED for\
            \ New Construction&rdquo; as follows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for New\
            \ Construction was designed primarily for new commercial office buildings,\
            \ but it has been applied to many other building types by LEED practitioners.\
            \ All commercial buildings, as defined by standard building codes, are\
            \ eligible for certification as LEED for New Construction buildings. Examples\
            \ of commercial occupancies include offices, institutional buildings (libraries,\
            \ museums, churches, etc.), hotels, and residential buildings of 4 or\
            \ more habitable stories.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for New Construction\
            \ addresses design and construction activities for both new buildings\
            \ and major renovations of existing buildings. A major renovation involves\
            \ major HVAC renovation, significant envelope modifications, and major\
            \ interior rehabilitation. For a major renovation of an existing building,\
            \ LEED for New Construction is the appropriate rating system. If the project\
            \ scope does not involve significant design and construction activities\
            \ and focuses more on operations and maintenance activities, LEED for\
            \ Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance is more appropriate\
            \ because it addresses operational and maintenance issues of working buildings.</em></p>\r\
            \n<p><em>Some projects are designed and constructed to be partially occupied\
            \ by the owner or developer, and partially occupied by others tenants.\
            \ In such projects, the owner or developer has direct influence over the\
            \ portion of the work that they occupy. For such a project to pursue LEED\
            \ for New Construction certification, the owner or tenant must occupy\
            \ more than 50% of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage. Projects\
            \ in which 50% or less of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage\
            \ is occupied by an owner should pursue LEED for Core &amp; Shell certification.</em></p>\r\

            \ for Core &amp; Shell Rating System is a market-specific application\
            \ that recognizes the unique nature of core and shell development. The\

            \ of influence a developer can exert in a speculatively developed building.</em></p>\r\
            \n<p><em>LEED for Core &amp; Shell was developed to serve the speculative\
            \ development market, in which project teams do not control all scopes\
            \ of a whole building&rsquo;s design and construction. Depending on how\
            \ the project is structured, this scope can vary significantly from project\
            \ to project. The LEED for Core &amp; Shell Rating System addresses a\
            \ variety of project types and a broad project range.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED\
            \ for Core &amp; Shell can be used for projects in which the developer\
            \ controls the design and construction of the entire core and shell base\
            \ building (e.g., mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection\
            \ systems) but has no control over the design and construction of the\
            \ tenant fit-out. Examples of this type of project can be a commercial\
            \ office building, medical office building, retail center, warehouse,\
            \ and lab facility.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>If a project is designed and constructed\
            \ to be partially occupied by the owner or developer, then the owner or\
            \ developer has direct influence over that portion of the interior build-out\
            \ work. For these projects to pursue LEED for Core &amp; Shell certification,\
            \ the owner must occupy 50% or less of the building&rsquo;s leasable square\
            \ footage. Projects in which more than 50% of the building&rsquo;s tenant\

            \ into a vast network of transmission wires, often referred to as &ldquo;the\
            \ grid.&rdquo; The grid is segmented into regional power networks called\
            \ pools. To help facilitate the sale of renewable electricity nationally,\
            \ a system was established that separates renewable electricity generation\
            \ into two parts: the electricity or electrical energy produced by a renewable\
            \ generator and the renewable &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; of that generation.\

            \ by generating electricity from renewable resources instead of conventional\
            \ fuels, such as coal, nuclear, oil, or gas.) These renewable (&ldquo;green&rdquo;)\
            \ attributes are sold separately as renewable energy certificates (RECs).\
            \ One REC is issued for each megawatt-hour (MWh) unit of renewable electricity\
            \ produced. The electricity that was split from the REC is no longer considered\
            \ \"renewable\" and cannot be counted as renewable or zero-emissions by\
            \ whoever buys it.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>RECs contain specific information\
            \ about the renewable energy generated, including where, when, at what\
            \ facility, and with what type of generation. Purchasers of RECs are buying\
            \ the renewable attributes of those specific units of renewable energy,\
            \ which helps offset conventional electricity generation in the region\
            \ where the renewable generator is located.</em></p>", type: numeric,

            \ from an individual with relevant expertise in the associated content\
            \ area. The letter should affirm how the innovation meets the criteria\
            \ outlined above.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if an institution claims an innovation\
            \ credit for water use reduction, the institution might solicit a letter\
            \ from a hydrologist or a water expert from another campus or organization\
            \ to verify that the strategy is innovative. An innovation may be affirmed\
            \ internally by campus personnel who are independent of the policy, practice,\
            \ program, or outcome. Please note that it is not required that the individual\
            \ be employed in the higher education sector to submit a letter of verification.</p>\r\
            \n<p>The letter should be specific to a single innovation credit. If an\
