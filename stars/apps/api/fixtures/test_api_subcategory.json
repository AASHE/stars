Modern industrial food production often has deleterious environmental impacts.&nbsp; Pesticides and fertilizers used in agriculture can contaminate ground and surface water, which has potentially dangerous impacts on wildlife and human health.&nbsp; Furthermore, the often long-distance transportation of food to institutions produces greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution.&nbsp; Additionally, farm workers are often paid sub-standard wages, subjected to harsh working conditions, and exposed to dangerous pesticides. Institutions can use their food purchases to support their local economies; encourage safe, environmentally-friendly farming methods; and help alleviate poverty for farmers.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that while dining services can also play an important role in conserving energy and water, reducing waste, and purchasing environmentally preferable materials other than food, STARS measures these impacts across the institution instead of by department; therefore, the benefits of these actions are captured in the Energy, Water, Waste, and Purchasing subcategories, respectively.</p>",

Water conservation and effective stormwater management also reduce the need for effluent discharge into local surface water supplies, which helps improve the health of local water ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>",
