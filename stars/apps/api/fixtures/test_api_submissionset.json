Because STARS is not fully developed to capture the hospital and medical center operations of a large institution such as UCLA (for instance, the weighted campus user figure does not have a way to address patients or beds per day), many universities, including UCLA, have chosen to apply STARS to their main campus, using a scope that does not include their medical centers. However, we do track all of the same operational data for our medical center and UCLA\u2019s Health System is truly a leader in sustainability. Both hospitals, Reagan and Santa Monica, received awards this year from Practice Greenhealth, a national organization focused on hospital sustainability. The Health System is pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce energy use and waste, and has eliminated styrofoam in their dining facilities. We will be reporting on Health System Sustainability separately within our sustainability report and on our site (www.sustain.ucla.edu). \r\n",
