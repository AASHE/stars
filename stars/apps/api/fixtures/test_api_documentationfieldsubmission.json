            "value": "PLU has multiple student groups:GREAN, Sustainability Committee, Climate Change Ambassadors, RHA, ASPLU\r\n\r\n\u2022Grass Roots Environmental Action Now (GREAN) is a student run campus group whose mission statement reads, \u201cOur mission is to promote environmental awareness and action on campus and in the community.\u201d  They do this by meeting weekly to plan campus events regarding issues of sustainability, and by taking on environmentally related projects around campus.\r\noIn 2008, the Board of Regents passed a resolution proposed by GREAN (by petition of 1100 students) that students are willing to pay $20/year to go towards the purchasing of green tags, and energy conservation efforts across campus.\r\noIn the 2008-2009 academic year, GREAN sponsored the Take Back the Tap Campaign, which provided reusable water bottles to students for $1 and a commitment that they would move away from the use of bottled water.  This campaign happened in collaboration with the department of Dining Services, who agreed to pull bottled water from their shelves for the week of the campaign.  \r\n\r\n\u2022Climate Change Ambassadors were a group of 16 students and 1 faculty advisor that met during the January and Spring terms of the 2008-2009 school year, and were funded by the Wiancko Charitable Foundation. Their primary goal was to educate students on and off campus about climate change, and potential ways to mitigate the effects.\r\n\r\n\u2022Residence Hall Association (RHA) is an elected body of 8 students with 2 professional staff advisors.  One of the 8 positions is the Sustainability Director. They are responsible for sustainability programming for the on campus population.  Under this position, Sustainability Coordinators are chosen for each residence hall on campus that program specifically for their halls and report back to the RHA director.  Some recent programs RHA sponsored or co-sponsored include: Take Back the Tap, composting programs in the halls, and student education campaigns.\r\n\r\n\u2022Associated Students of Pacific Lutheran University (ASPLU) is our student government organization.  In terms of sustainability efforts, ASPLU has a sustainability director who partners with and supports other programs for events around campus.  One of their primary responsibilities is to be a part of programming that is happening within other committees, and suggest potential alternatives to unsustainable practices or elements of events.  For example, the 2007-2008 Spring formal was (by suggestion of the sustainability director) held on campus to eliminate the need for transportation to the event: saving energy, and money.  ASPLU is also responsible for educating first year students during their no-waste picnic during orientation weekend.  Everything that is used at this picnic can be reused, recycled, or composted.  During the liveGREEN pledge of 2007 (created by then ASPLU vice president and Sustainability Fellow, Tamara Power-Drutis), approximately 200 students, staff, faculty and groups signed the pledge, with ASPLU committing to waste reduction practices.  Following this commitment, they supported events like \u201cCan the Can\u201d, which provided 1.5 liter trash cans to promote more recycling, and less waste production.\r\nSo far in the 09-10 School year, ASPLU has supported unPLUg, a program run out of the sustainability office, round two of Take Back the Tap, and encouraged students to contact their senators regarding support for clean energy bill that was being considered.\r\n\r\nAdditional webpages: \r\nhttp://news.plu.edu/node/2323 \r\nhttp://www.plu.edu/rha/Advocacy/Sustainability.php",

The creation of the AMS Lighter Footprint Strategy in 2008 provides a framework for walking the talk. From local food security, responsible consumption, and a youth climate action coalition to a water bottle-free campus campaign, community-based social marketing and the Natural Step Framework, the Lighter Footprint Strategy initiative showcases the many faces of sustainability, strives to build stronger campus sustainability networks and fosters sustainable behavior change in our everyday life. \r\n\r\nBIKE KITCHEN\r\nwww.thebikekitchen.com\r\nThe Bike Kitchen is UBC's non-profit, student-owned, full-service bike shop.  The shop was founded by the UBC Bike Co-op, with the support of the UBC Alma Mater Society and the Trek Program Centre.  At the Bike Kitchen, you can purchase a fully refurbished and guaranteed used bicycle; donate your old bike and parts; fix your bike with our tools; learn to fix your bike if you don't already know how; leave your bike for repairs if you're too busy; and choose from a wide selection of new and used parts and accessories. \r\n\r\nFRIENDS OF THE UBC FARM\r\nwww.friendsoftheubcfarm.wordpress.com\r\nFriends of the UBC Farm (FotF) is a group open to both students (as a UBC Alma Mater Society club) and the wider community. Our mission is to support the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at the UBC Farm by increasing awareness about the value of the UBC Farm and its education, research and community outreach programs at UBC and wider communities. Of course, we love food, and we love doing fun activities relating to land, food and community.\u2028 This year, FotF will be working to support the successful adoption of the Sustainability Academic Strategy and the South Campus Academic Plan, which outline the long-term future for the farm. We will also continue to organize fun workshops and events at the farm, and raise awareness about the farm through our presence at outreach events throughout the city. If you are interested in connecting with this great community of students and non-students, feel free to drop into our weekly meetings or send us an e-mail.\u2028\r\n\r\nSPROUTS\r\nwww.ubcsprouts.ca\r\nSprouts is a 100% volunteer and student-run organization at UBC. Through our many initiatives we endeavour to make healthy, affordable, and sustainably produced food accessible to everyone on campus. Sprouts is a favourite destination for seasonal organic soups, fresh organic bread, baked goods, and fair trade coffee. We also offer workshops and a grocery delivery service, organize a bulk grocery buying club, and host a bi-weekly free lunch (Community Eats). A dynamic, volunteer-powered initiative, we aim to connect customers to the land and people that grow their food. \r\n\r\nSTUDENT ENVIRONMENT CENTRE\r\nwww.ams.ubc.ca/campus-life/ams-resource-groups/student-environment-centre/\r\nThe Student Environment Centre (SEC) is a resource group mandated by the UBC Alma Mater Society for people within the UBC community who are concerned, or would like to learn more about, environmental problems and the broader issues of sustainability facing our planet. We provide environmental and sustainability resources to the UBC community and organize events throughout the year on campus, such as Responsible Consumption Week, and events for our members, such as the annual Bike to Wildwood. If you have an idea for an environmental event or program, you can apply to SEC for funding and we are happy to provide advice, volunteers, funding and any other support you may need for your project. \r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\nFACULTY ASSOCIATED GROUPS:\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE UNDERGRAD SOCIETY\r\nhttp://blogs.landfood.ubc.ca/agus\r\nThe Agriculture Undergrad Society (AGUS) is a student-run organization committed to building a sense of community within the Faculty of Land and Food Systems. From growing and harvesting to cooking and eating, the faculty knows all about food and understands the unique ability food has to bring people together. The AGUS knows that students may not always have the means or time to cook nutritious meals for themselves. With this in mind, every week AGUS members plan, shop for and prepare dinner for students, faculty and staff. The dinners have grown in popularity, and now the AGUS serves meals for upwards of 100 people each week. The menu focuses around local seasonal food and tries to uses produce from the UBC Farm and the Faculty of Land and Food Systems Orchard Garden when available. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING SUSTAINABILITY CLUB\r\nwww.chbe.ubc.ca/sustainability\r\nThe Chemical and Biological Engineering (CHBE) Sustainability Club is made up of students and faculty who wish to serve as a model of sustainability for individual members and our University community. The main goal of the club is to foster a culture of sustainability in the department and on campus. This is achieved through Education, Academic Integration and Enhancement of department sustainability. The club organizes events, including movie nights, regular speaker series, field trips and large e-waste collection. The club also has a number of ongoing projects, including a bi-weekly newsletter, organic waste collection, e-waste collection and a departmental sustainability assessment. Please contact us if you would like to receive the newsletter or become involved with the club. We welcome new members from any department. \r\n\r\nCOMMERCE UNDERGRADUATE SOCIETY SUSTAINABILITY\r\nwww.cussustainability.com\r\nThe Commerce Undergraduate Society (CUS) Sustainability's mission is to provide opportunities for Sauder School of Business students to educate themselves on what sustainability means in the context of business; to motivate students to integrate sustainability into their professional and personal lives; and to use the Commerce Undergraduate Society as a model for how sustainability can be implemented into the operations and strategic thinking of an organization. In only its second year of operation, CUS Sustainability has successfully hosted two Chasing Sustainability Conferences, which have brought together a diverse and engaged group of students, faculty, and members of Vancouver\u2019s business community in an intimate, discussion-oriented setting aimed at educating students about the current paradigm shift affecting the business world. Through the efforts of CUS Sustainability, the Sauder School of Business is now offering a Business and Sustainability concentration.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENTAL LAW GROUP (ELG)\r\nhttp://faculty.law.ubc.ca/environ/\r\nThe Environmental Law Group (ELG) is a student-run organization operating out of the Faculty of Law at UBC. Our primary goal is to promote greater awareness of the legal aspects of current environmental problems to the community and to offer opportunities to law students to understand the practice of environmental law. The ELG sponsors many events at the law school, including an Environmental Negotiation Competition, Career Panel, field trips, and more. In the past year, the ELG has hosted these and other events, and submitted environmental suggestions to the committee planning a new law building.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION OF UBC\r\nhttp://clubs.ams.ubc.ca/clubs/essa/\r\nThe Environmental Science Students Association (ESSA) is the student club representing the environmental science program at UBC.

We also take part in events promoting public awareness of environmental issues. \r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY STUDENTS ASSOCIATION\r\nhttp://www.ubcgsa.com\r\nThe Geography Students Association (GSA) is one of the most active student organizations on campus. The GSA strives to build and maintain a sense of community within the geography department, and maintain a liaison between the students, staff and faculty. We promote social, academic and leadership opportunities for our members and strive to make our club and department sustainable socially, environmentally and economically. The GSA offers beer gardens, majors nights, graduate school information sessions, bake sales, a UBC Rec sports team, field trips and many more community events.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL STUDENTS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT\r\nhttp://ubcmed.com/index.php\r\nClimate change and environmental degradation increasingly threaten life on this planet. As future health care providers, we believe that we must make every effort to reduce our environmental impacts in both our professional and private lives. Medical Students for the Environment (MSE) connects environmentally-minded medical students and promotes awareness of the intricate connections between health and the environment. Simply put, what is good for the environment is good for health. \r\n\r\nUBC EMERGING GREEN BUILDERS\r\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/ubcegb/\r\nThe UBC Emerging Green Builders (UBC EGB) engages a robust inter-disciplinary network of students, scholars, professors, practitioners, and administrators concerned with the future of the built environment.

In other words, we believe that the UBC community of students, faculty and staff should work together to reduce our climate footprint AND create solutions for a climate neutral future. We envision a campus that does more to solve the climate crisis than it does to cause it. We envision UBC setting an example of the political, social, environmental, and economic solutions needed to build livable futures in the context of the climate crisis. Common Energy has a proven history of success and is continually adapting to achieve its vision. We currently have four subgroups\u2013Challenges, Education, Dialogue and Tangible Solutions\u2013working in dynamic ways for a beyond climate neutral campus. \r\n\r\nENGINEERS WITHOUT BORDERS UBC\r\nhttp://ubc.ewb.ca/\r\nThe UBC chapter of Engineers Without Borders is a dedicated family of student volunteers, working to improve the livelihood of people in developing countries. And it\u2019s not just for engineers! We are one of 34 professional and student chapters that is working to create lasting change.

Forming a rich mosaic of cultivated fields, teaching gardens, forest stands, hedgerows, and orchard plantings, the farm is a unique urban agrarian gem. In close proximity and fully integrated with a world-class community of researchers, the CSFS affords an opportunity to better understand and manage the characteristics of the ecosystems that support urbanizing societies. As the only working farmland within the city of Vancouver, the UBC Farm\u2019s urban interface enhances research opportunities that also address community, ecosystem and global health.\r\n\r\nThe UBC Farm provides many opportunities for students to gain practical skills in organic food production. In addition to several highly active volunteer programs, Community Service-Learning (CSL) opportunities and internships for students, the CSFS at UBC Farm is pleased to offer 'Sowing Seeds for the Future: Practicum in Sustainable Agriculture,' a hands-on, season-long practicum in sustainable agriculture. \r\n\r\nTHE ORCHARD GARDEN\r\nhttp://outdoorclassroomubc.blogspot.com/\r\nThe UBC Orchard Garden is the brainchild of students in Agroecology Self-Directed Studies, the Land, Food & Community III (AGSC 450) course and the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm. In the spring of 2007, students tilled and prepared soil on the west side of the MacMillan Building. \u201cThe Orchard Garden\u201d title is intended to reflect this particular area\u2019s history as an apple orchard.\r\n\r\nPreviously occupied by portable offices, the Garden is now designated as informal learning space within UBC Vancouver's Public Realm Plan. The Orchard Garden complements the UBC Farm as a garden-scale outdoor classroom for hands-on, holistic learning about sustainable food systems, from production to consumption and disposal. It also provides a space for transforming teacher education through innovative curriculum and pedagogy design. Diners at the student-run Agora Cafe and the Agriculture Undergraduate Society's weekly barbeques enjoy delicious \u201cbackyard garden\u201d treats from The Orchard Garden that include early potatoes, garlic, beets, kale and squash.

Inspirations & Aspirations: The UBC Sustainability Strategy (2006-2010) outlines specific targets and strategies (http://www.sustain.ubc.ca/pdfs/ia/UBC_Sustainability_Strategy_2007.pdf). Practices include the following: \r\n\r\nMINIMIZING IMPACTS ON SURROUNDING SITES\r\nUBC has suspended the use of  all chemical pesticides for 'cosmetic' use across campus, and no chemical pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides are used unless there are extenuating circumstances and all other options have been exhausted; UBC has incorporated innovative stormwater practices into its campus planning since 1997; and UBC generates its own compost for landscaping by collecting food waste and processing it in a facility on campus. \r\n\r\nMINIMIZING ENERGY CONSUMPTION\r\nHighlights of UBC's energy conservation tactics include an Energy Management Plan, a Climate Action Plan with extremely aggressive GHG reduction targets, an automated Building Management System, and a rolling Continuous Optimization program (includes energy audits, implementation of energy conservation measures and monitoring).\r\n\r\nPURCHASING ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE MATERIALS\r\nUBC's practices include Green Housekeeping in green and non-green buildings and progressive procurement practices, outlined in the UBC Sustainable Purchasing Guide. The Technical Guidelines outline requirements and preferences for materials procured for renovations and upgrades, in addition to new construction.\r\n\r\nPROTECTING INDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY\r\nUBC provides information, support and programming through its Risk Management: Health & Safety Group, and a responsive trouble call system for building occupants through Building Operations. Project Services implements the asbestos abatement and removal program.\r\n\r\nMINIMIZING WATER CONSUMPTION\r\nUBC has reduced water consumption in buildings through major retrofit projects and improved landscaping/irrigation practices, and has started engaging staff and faculty in labs to reduce water consumption as part of a Green Labs program.   \r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit: http://www.sustain.ubc.ca/campus-sustainability/greening-the-campus.",

Another layer of accountability was added by the provincial government in 2008. Since 2008, the Province of BC has required all public sector new construction and major renovations to be certified LEED Gold. UBC has consistently upheld this requirement, and went further by adding its own minimum energy performance threshold (42% below Canada's Model National Energy Code for Buidings). Within the new Vancouver Campus Plan Design Guidelines, UBC made additional LEED credits mandatory: stormwater rate and quantity management, and 75% construction waste diversion. http://www.technicalguidelines.ubc.ca/technical/sustainability.html\r\n\r\nRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION\r\nUBC created its own Residential Environmental Assessment Program (REAP) in 2006. REAP is a green building rating system that is mandatory for all multifamily homes built at UBC. REAP applies to private developers  and UBC-as-developer alike,  including rental homes and homes for sale, whether they are for students, faculty & staff, or the general market. http://sustain.ubc.ca/campus-sustainability/greening-the-campus/residential-environmental-assessment-program",

Over 200 UBC students, staff, faculty and community members contributed expertise and recommendations to the UBC Climate Action Plan.  \r\n\r\nUBC President Stephen Toope announced the Climate Action Plan targets on March 24, 2010, committing UBC to ambitious campus-wide GHG reductions. Compared to the 2007 emissions baseline, GHG emissions at UBC will be reduced 33 percent by 2015, 67 percent by 2020, and 100 percent by 2050.  \r\n\r\nTo achieve the target of reducing emissions to 67% below 2007 levels by 2020, UBC will focus on converting to a sustainable energy system on campus and decoupling energy use from GHG emissions through the deployment of renewable technologies. This target will be met through fuel switching from natural gas to renewable sources. \r\n\r\nTo achieve the target of reducing emissions by 100% below 2007 levels by 2050, UBC will eliminate Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from campus activities through the implementation of a carbon neutral energy supply. Residual emissions will be negated through the export of energy to a portion of the UBC community resulting in a net energy positive campus. ",

Conceived as a regenerative building process and designed to be the most innovative high performance building in North America, CIRS will be the home of the UBC Sustainability Initiative (USI) and a focal point for sustainability research and partnerships, teaching and learning, and operational activities.\r\n\r\nCIRS will demonstrate leading-edge research and sustainable design, products, systems, and decision-making in three ways: 1) A state-of-the-art \u201cliving laboratory\u201d will allow researchers and building industry partners to undertake research on, and assessment of, current and future sustainable building systems and technologies; 2) Advanced visualization, simulation, and community engagement technologies and processes will support research on new approaches to interacting with citizens in exploring sustainable lifestyles; and 3) Partners from the private, public and NGO sectors will share the research facility, working with CIRS researchers to identify areas in which this region has a competitive edge in sustainable technologies and services and helping to implement these on the ground, as a springboard to the export market. \r\n\r\nCIRS will harvest waste heat, renewable energy and rainwater to supply 100% of the space heating energy required, about 10% of its electricity demand and 100% of its potable water needs.  Wastewater produced in the building will be treated to tertiary standards using a bio-filtration process and recycled to flush toilets and urinals and for irrigation purposes. \r\n\r\nCIRS will make its local environment better by collecting energy and exporting it to nearby buildings, biologically treating and recycling wastewater from other campus buildings, re-directing storm-water runoff into the local aquifer, providing habitat for local species and enriching the public realm and local community. Through a high quality indoor environment CIRS will make its building inhabitants measurably healthier, happier and more productive.\r\n\r\nAll building inhabitants will have access to daylight and natural ventilation and will be able to adjust the airflow and air temperature affecting their local environment.  Additionally, building inhabitants will have access to real-time building performance data and will be able to participate in the implementation of different building operation strategies with the goal of achieving improvements in energy and resource use efficiency over time.\r\n\r\nConceived as a dynamic process the design of CIRS will make it easier to adopt changes in space use and occupancy and to respond to advances in IT, AV and building automation and controls technologies. The interior design of CIRS includes a raised floor system with under-floor air, power and data distribution for maximum flexibility, and demountable partitions that can be easily reconfigured.  \r\n\r\nA robust building management system (BMS) coupled with a building technology software platform and energy and water management interfaces will enable the testing and demonstration of new building technologies in the future as well as the implementation of new and more efficient building operation algorithms. A stringent measurement and verification program for the continuous auditing of energy use and building performance will also be implemented.",

In 2003, UCLA developed campus green building and operational guidelines modeled on LEED and Labs21. Documentation and credit requirements were nearly identical to those systems, but adapted to reflect Campus circumstances. Review and validation of compliance was by UCLA Campus Building Officials and the Office of the Campus Architect.  Since 2009, the UC policy has required all eligible new construction to achieve LEED certification at the Silver Level, certified through the USGBC and GBCI. The policy also includes requirements for sustainable operations. Implementation of LEED EBOM began with the preparation of a campus EBOM pilot project. At UCLA, this was the Public Affairs Building, which was Silver certified by the USGBC.  \r\n\r\nAdditional links:\r\n\r\nAppendix 2, Feasibility Study for a Green Building Policy : http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sustainability/documents/gbfeasibility.pdf\r\n   \r\nAppendix 3, Feasibility Study for a Clean Energy Standard:  http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sustainability/documents/cefeasibility.pdf  \r\n\r\nUCLA 2006 Update to Green Building Policy:  http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/media/files/ucregentgreenbldg.pdf    \r\n\r\nClimate Action Plan: http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/cap/          \r\n\r\nCurrent UC Policy on Sustainable Practices and Policy Guidelines: http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sustainability/documents/policy_sustain_prac.pdf     \r\n\r\nUCLA Housing and Hospitality Sustainability Strategic Plan: http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/media/files/zSustStratPlan_5-20-09.pdf \r\n\r\nSustainability Charter: http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/media/files/Sustainability-Charter.pdf \r\n\r\nUCLA Energy Conservation: http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.789d0eb6c76e7ef0d66b02ddf848344a/?vgnextoid=a9db26a6486f6110VgnVCM100000e1d76180RCRD  \r\n\r\nUCLA Green Purchasing Policy: http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.789d0eb6c76e7ef0d66b02ddf848344a/?vgnextoid=b1d700e0fdfd1010VgnVCM1000008f8443a4RCRD \r\n\r\nUCLA Water Conservation: http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/get_involved/article.asp?parentid=261 \r\n\r\nUCLA Waste Reduction and Recycling: http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.789d0eb6c76e7ef0d66b02ddf848344a/?vgnextoid=615355fb84eb6110VgnVCM100000e1d76180RCRD \r\n\r\nUCLA indoor air quality and environmental impact management: http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.2bceb61fc98129c1ae13e110f848344a/?vgnextoid=871082df180e1110VgnVCM100000dcd76180RCRD\r\n\r\nBruin Green Cleaning Program: http://sustain.ucla.edu/campus/article.asp?parentid=11164\r\n\r\nCurrent UC Policy on Sustainable Practices and Policy Guidelines, Sep-2009\r\n\r\nThe Public Affairs Building (201667 sf) was certified by the USGBC as a LEED-EB (Existing Building) Silver rated building renovation in January, 2009. The building earned 45 LEED-EB points.This was a pilot LEED Existing Building project for UCLA, which turned out quite successfully. The renovation of this existing building, and the LEED certification process was handled by UCLA's Facilities Management, as are all renovation projects. One of the biggest changes to the Public Affairs Building was a new heating, cooling and ventilation system, according to Robert Striff, a senior energy engineer in Facilities Management's Energy Services who helped guide the process. \"This is a 50-year-old building,\" Striff said. \"It didn't have an efficient heating and cooling system, so when we converted it to the most efficient system possible, given the building's size constraints, that made a big difference.\" Everything about the Public Affairs Building is now metered \u2013 the water for plumbing, the chilled water for cooling, the electricity for lights, the steam for heating \u2013 so it's easy to measure progress, Striff added. Facilities Management also added features occupancy sensors for the lights and ultra-low-flush urinals. A pre-existing white roof, which reflects heat from sunlight and lessens the need for air-conditioning, also helped the Public Affairs Building snag a good LEED score. Green practices that were already in place also helped, Facilities Management's Energy Services Engineer, Paul Butapetch said.\r\n\r\n* (Above quotes from \"Building's Green Makeover Wins High Score UC-Wide\"; http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/building-s-green-makeover-wins-94602.aspx)",

Since then, the UC has gained further national recognition by demonstrating the unique role that higher education can play in addressing sustainability issues.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 2009-2010 Capital Financial Plan, UCLA utilizes a variety of methods to ensure that the issue of environmental sustainability is addressed. The UC Sustainability Policy addresses sustainability and green buildings on the UC campuses. The Policy sets aggressive goals for the ten UC campuses to continue to reduce their carbon footprints. These goals represent a challenge for UCLA as the campus expands and demand for energy increases (through growth in the use of technology). Incorporating energy efficiency into new buildings and renovations as part of the Green Building Program has allowed UCLA to continue to reduce the amount of energy used on a square-foot basis, despite overall campus growth. All UCLA projects are designed to comply with the requirements of the Policy. The Policy adopts green building standards using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system and includes stringent energy conservation measures. UCLA is committed to achieving a minimum LEED Silver certification for all new construction and major renovation projects.\r\n\r\nAbove from http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/regents/regmeet/jul09/gb3attach.pdf)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in the Capital Financial Plan, \"Build A Sustainable Campus\" is one of three major Capital Strategic Initiatives. The plan details green building, transportation, energy conservation and other sustainability programs and goals. One of the other strategic initiatives- \"Transform UCLA to a Residential Academic Community\" is also related to sustainability, as increasing the amount of students and staff living on campus decreases commutes and builds community. \r\n\r\n2009-2010 Capital Financial Plan: http://www.ucop.edu/capitalprojects/documents/cfp09-10/la.pdf\r\n\r\nUCLA's Strategic Plan clearly addresses pertinent environmental issues and provides a framework to guide UCLA to implement environmentally friendly building technologies and energy efficient design strategies.

The UC Policy set three climate change goals for the 10 UC campuses:\r\n\u2022Reduction in campus emissions to year 2000 levels by 2014;\r\n\u2022Reduction in campus emissions to year 1990 levels by 2020; and\r\n\u2022Attainment of climate neutrality as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThese goals are in parallel with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Assembly Bill 32) and based on the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, which the UC President and the UC Council of Chancellor\u2019s signed, joining university leaders across the country. The UC policy also calls for UC campuses to draft a Climate Action Plan (CAP) that examines the feasibility of meeting these goals. \r\n\r\nUCLA has a decades-long history of pursuing sustainable practices in campuswide operations and has established extensive academic, research, and community outreach programs in climate change and sustainability. By building upon past achievements, UCLA's Climate Action Plan (CAP) outlines a comprehensive range of initiatives to advance campus sustainable practices and further reduce UCLA\u2019s carbon footprint. The UCLA Climate Action Plan addresses carbon emission reduction initiatives including behavioral change, energy use and conservation, student and workforce commutes, and air travel. The Climate Action Plan also examines the feasibility of these initiatives and determines a target for UCLA greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Every initiative that is implemented moves the campus closer to achieving the ultimate goal of climate neutrality.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the system-wide emission reduction targets, UCLA has set the following targets specific to transportation: \r\n  \r\n  *     Increase number of PZEV/ZV/ATPZEV Fleet vehicles by 20% by 2010\r\n    *     Increase number of PZEV/ZV/ATPZEV Fleet vehicles by 40% by 2014\r\n    *     Increase number of PZEV/ZV/ATPZEV Fleet vehicles by 70% by 2020\r\n    *     Estimated that entire campus Fleet will run on non-carbon based fuel by 2050\r\n    *     Reduce employee single occupant vehicle ridership to 50%\r\n    *     Maintain employee single occupant vehicle at 50% with anticipated population growth\r\n    *     Reduce faculty/staff air travel by 5% by 2020 ",

            "value": "UCLA's comprehensive Climate Action Plan lays out a plan for the university to achieve that goal several years ahead of schedule. The plan was authored by members of the UCLA Sustainability Committee, founded in 2005 and made up of students, staff and faculty that help catalyze and prioritize sustainability initiatives on campus.  The plan catalogues the steps the University has taken in the past and contains a detailed financial feasibility analysis for the initiatives the University will undertake in energy and transportation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).\r\n\r\nThis Climate Action Plan considers initiatives that focus on reductions in GHG emissions from stationary source energy use (i.e. Cogeneration Plant and purchased utilities) and emissions from mobile sources (campus fleet vehicles, commutes, and air travel). The GHG reduction initiatives described in this CAP fall into three main categories:\r\n\r\n\u2022energy use reduction and efficiency;\r\n\u2022mobility \u2013 reduction in vehicle miles traveled and utilization of alternative transportation modes; and\r\n\u2022behavioral changes aimed at influencing individual and institutional choices related to energy use and mobility.\r\n\r\nEnergy initiatives include building system upgrades that improve efficiency of heating and cooling equipment, installation of more energy efficient lighting systems, and inclusion of \u201cgreen\u201d power and solar energy in the campus\u2019 energy portfolio. Improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings and pursuing alternative energy sources will result in a significant reduction in the GHG emissions of the campus.\r\n\r\nTransportation initiatives will increase the number of clean and alternative fuel fleet vehicles, reduce single-occupant commutes to campus, and possibly establish an emissions mitigation fund for air travel, all of which would contribute to a substantial emission reduction potential.\r\n\r\nThis Climate Action Plan also recognizes that behavior change is at the core of many of UCLA\u2019s proposed initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Behavioral change toward more sustainable practices, though difficult to quantify in terms of emissions reduction, is inherent in all GHG emission reduction initiatives. Provision of sustainability education awareness in campus operations continues to positively influence areas such as recycling, purchasing, housing, dining, as well as energy and water conservation. With engagement and support from the Campus Sustainability Committee and a full-time campus sustainability coordinator, a \u201cculture of sustainability\u201d is emerging campuswide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these initiatives, academic and research initiatives addressed in this Climate Action Plan will have an enduring benefit by creating new technologies and training students to become leaders in addressing challenges of global climate change for years to come.",

By definition, sustainability requires a multi-disciplinary perspective.  The LiS program allows students to create a program tailored to their needs and background, by choosing among the sustainability related courses and opportunities at UCLA.  Students take a core course in sustainability and relevant electives and participate in leadership training. Additionally, students have a positive impact on the community as they learn experientially by collaborating on client projects for local businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies. LiS students also give themselves a career edge by developing a broad knowledge of topics that are increasingly relevant to employers. The program is open to all graduate students at UCLA (masters and doctoral) and is offered with no additional fees.\r\n\r\nThe program first started in the Anderson School of Management and has been administered by the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability since 2009.  The program has been quite successful with 85+ graduates so far and more than 160 students currently enrolled representing more than 30 different programs as diverse as Anderson School of Management, School of Law, Luskin School of Public Affairs, School of Public Health, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, School of Arts & Architecture, School of Nursing, and numerous departments in the College of Letters and Science including Asian Languages and Cultures, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Chemistry, Geography and others.\r\n\r\nStudents are required to take four courses (16+ units of study) and complete a Leadership Project: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Leaders in Sustainability core course (4 units): Introduction to the concept of sustainability and the leadership skills students will need to make a positive impact on their chosen dimension of sustainability.  This class combines environmental, social and economic perspectives in a wide range of contexts, using a mix of class formats to bring out the unique multidisciplinary nature of the audience.\r\n\r\n\u2022 3 or more additional graduate-level courses: (at least 12 units, or equivalent in semester units): Students select courses from economics, engineering, environment, law, management, natural sciences, public health, public policy, social sciences, and urban planning, among others.  At least one of these three courses must be outside a student\u2019s home school.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Sustainability Leadership project: All students must complete a project related to sustainability (may be part of the students\u2019 regular departmental graduation requirements). Examples of past projects include:\r\n  o starting a nonprofit organization with UCLA alums, called the Los Angeles Sustainability Collaborative, that funds graduate students to conduct research on issues of environmental sustainability;\r\n  o co-organization of the annual California Clean Innovation conference;\r\n  o  serving as Editor in Chief of the UCLA Journal of Environmental Law and Policy;\r\n  o helping initiate, plan, and implement the first Bicycle and Pedestrian Count for the City of Los Angeles to gauge how infrastructure is being used to measure changes over time.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the formal requirements of the certificate program, all students are encouraged to participate actively in relevant events organized by the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability and other units, including seminars, conferences, etc.\r\n\r\nThe LiS program was recently awarded the 2010 Dr. Alfred and Lynn Manos Page Prize for Sustainability Issues in Business Curricula. The Page Prize encourages efforts to expose business students to state-of-the-art environmental sustainability knowledge.\r\n\r\n",

At UCLA, the program is supported and administered by the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability (IoES).\r\n\r\nThe ESLP program consists of three components that are all student-led; a speaker series, a film series and Action Research Teams (ART).  The speaker series and ART are taken for course credit through the IoES (Environment 185A/B/C) and may apply towards the Environmental Systems and Society minor offered by the Institute. \r\n\r\nThrough the ART component of the program, students form research teams to tackle issues of campus sustainability including energy efficiency, transportation, waste stream management, sustainable food practices and more. The goal of ART is to generate a coalition of student researchers that, together with faculty members and UCLA staff, strives to make UCLA a model campus and national leader in sustainability.  Each ART team is comprised of two team leaders, 3-6 team members, and a UCLA faculty or staff member that serves as the project stakeholder. The stakeholder is responsible for helping students target their research by serving as a mentor as well as acting as a liaison by offering logistical support and advice on behalf of the University\u2019s interests.  \r\n\r\nOver the course of two quarters, winter and spring, students are expected to frame their research topic, develop a hypothesis and research plan, compile and analyze data, complete a 15-20 page group report on their findings, and present their results at an event open to all UCLA faculty, staff and students.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire process, students meet with their stakeholders to continually refine their research and identify targets of possible change through new information gained from action research. The two-quarter time frame allows for an in-depth journey that enables a thorough analysis of the research project.  The ART projects provide campus stakeholders with invaluable information they would not otherwise have the capacity to gather.  All participants work together to make UCLA more sustainable, which also contributes to creating a sense of community on campus.\r\n\r\nART has impacted many sectors of campus by tackling a wide range of topics including: food systems and dining hall waste, overhaul of campus waste and recycling system, greening laboratories, mapping trees on campus, residence hall energy metering to affect behavior, hospital initiatives, greening the Greek system, drought-tolerant landscaping, curriculum assessment and enhancement, recreational facilities, paperless course evaluations, promoting fair trade products, educating student groups on being sustainable, and more.         \r\n\r\nTo date, over 170 students from more than 30 different departments have contributed thousands of hours toward making UCLA more sustainable and many teams have helped to save money, energy, water and carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nFunding for ESLP has been generously provided by the Dart Foundation, ASUCLA\u2019s The Green Initiative Fund and the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability.

The system triangulates designated stops and traffic patterns with actual bus locations to predict when the next BruinBus will arrive with an accuracy of within 1-2 minutes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe use of real-time technology is designed to better serve the University community and increase bus availability,\u201d said Maria Collins, UCLA Transit Manager. \u201cNot only will this put us at the forefront of the use of smart bus technology, but it will connect us directly with our customers.\u201d\r\n\r\nEach of the BruinBus stops around campus will display a designated bus stop code, a telephone number and a web link for real-time tracking. Riders simply go to the website or call the telephone number and enter the bus stop code to determine how many minutes before the arrival of the next two BruinBuses. Frequent users can simply program the number into their phone to quickly call whenever needed or set up alerts to automatically notify them of bus arrivals at a specific time.  Instead of repeatedly requesting arrival times, the user can simply set an alert for a specific stop daily.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis new system doesn\u2019t make the BruinBuses faster or more frequent, but there is something empowering about knowing you have time to grab a cup of coffee or tea before the next bus,\u201d said Collins.\r\n\r\nUCLA\u2019s annual one million plus BruinBus riders can now plan to arrive at the bus stop within moments of a bus\u2019 actual arrival time.  No more needless standing at a bus stop during inclement weather or after dark waiting for the bus to arrive.  And the time spent waiting at a shuttle stop wondering if you just missed the bus or how soon the next bus is coming will now be a thing of the past. This real-time technology will enable UCLA Fleet and Transit to deliver a more efficient shuttle program and will \u201cKeep UCLA Moving!\u201d ",

            "value": "Bruin Bikes Program\r\n\r\nThe UCLA Bruin Bikes Program was first launched in 2008, at the inaugural UCLA Sustainability Fair, and was the beginning of a series of incremental improvements in order to grow bicycle ridership on the UCLA campus. UCLA Transportation originally purchased 14 bicycles, five of which were provided to the UCLA Guest House and Tiverton House. The other nine bicycles were provided to different departments on campus. The bicycles provided for the UCLA Guest House and Tiverton House are available for visiting guests to check-out, free of charge, while staying at UCLA. Guests can use the bicycles for their transportation needs or for leisure rides around campus and into the adjacent Westwood Village. The bicycles provided for the departments are intended for employees to use as an alternative to departmental vehicles, in order to run short errands around UCLA. \r\n\r\nBy 2009, more departments on campus were interested in participating in the Bruin Bikes Program. Through funding provided by the UCLA FITWELL Program, UCLA Transportation and UCLA Recreation were able to procure an additional 24 bicycles. Seventeen bicycles were provided to departments on campus, and the additional seven bicycles replaced an outdated bicycle fleet that the UCLA Bike Shop rents for daily and weekly rates. Through the partnership with UCLA FITWELL, \u2018active sustainability\u2019 was coined. Active sustainability can be described as matching personal healthy living with better sustainability practices. \r\n\r\nBy 2010, another branch grew out of the Bruin Bike\u2019s tree, the UCLA Bike Library. Through a grant awarded by The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF), UCLA Transportation and UCLA Recreation were able to purchase 50 bicycles and construct additional  storage space to operate the Bike Library. The Bike Library allows students to rent a bicycle for $35 per quarter. The Bike Library is ideal for students looking for an inexpensive bicycle for a temporary period. UCLA impounds close to 100 bicycles annually, many of which are abandoned by students who are enrolled with UCLA for a short period of time. \r\n\r\nUCLA Recreation has supported the Bruin Bikes Program since its inception. UCLA Recreation oversees the UCLA Bike Shop, which sells bicycle accessories, and performs light bicycle repairs. The UCLA Bike Shop is responsible for overseeing maintenance and repair of all the bikes that are part of the Bruin Bikes Program.",

From November 1-19, residents of Hubbard Hall reduced their electricity use 15.9% compared to their baseline period measured from October 15-31.  As an award for their efforts, Hubbard\u2019s students received the coveted Student Energy Challenge Trophy and \u201cSustainable UNH\u201d t-shirts.",

In addition, key principles of the plan include accessibility, preserving the New England character of the built and natural environment, and strengthening the relationship with UNH's surrounding communities.\r\n\r\nAs the plan states on pages 30-31, \"The campus conceptual framework engages town and gown as well as the built and natural environments. The concept is centered on a compact academic village as the core of the University.  Student life uses, such as housing, meeting space, cultural, athletic, and recreational venues, surround the core and form a transition into the town and landscape.

Balance the Needs of the Built and Natural Environments \r\n5. Enhance the Character of the Campus\"\r\n\r\nAn overarching goal is to house as many students as feasible on campus and to condense the used areas of campus in order to preserve the surrounding natural environment, avoid vehicle miles and emissions, and promote a campus that is pedestrian and bike-friendly.\r\n\r\nSustainable Landscaping: UNH promotes and maintains sustainable landscaping throughout campus for the education and enjoyment of the community, the enhancement of natural systems, and the protection of biodiversity. A UNH Sustainable Landscaping Master Plan has become part of the umbrella UNH Campus Master Plan. Sustainable Design is also a part of the Campus Master Plan: As part of the Presidents Climate Commitment, UNH-Durham is committed to having all new campus construction and major renovation projects achieve U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver standards or equivalent; this policy will be applicable to all new projects initiated after UNH design and construction building standards have been modified in 2008. UNH Design Guidelines used by UNH Facilities Design and Construction require that designs use energy efficient systems and components and consider environmental impacts not just locally but also where the materials are derived from.\r\n\r\nThe UNH Campus Master Plan is being updated in 2011-2012.",

            "value": "Sustainability planning has been taking place at UNH for more than 15 years. In 1995 a grass roots effort by faculty, staff, students and administrators produced a white paper outlining goals and action steps to advance sustainability at UNH. That effort led to the establishment of the first endowed, university-wide sustainability program in the country in 1997. \r\n\r\nSince that time sustainability has emerged as a core identity of UNH, and as a result, sustainability planning has and continues to take many forms. Some has been coordinated, university-wide planning processes, such as planning for the UNH Sustainability Academy and the working group on sustainability in the UNH strategic planning process of 2009. Other planning has and continues to be ongoing and institutionalized in the form of mechanisms like the Energy Task Force and the Ecosystem Task Force. At the same time, planning is also ongoing at the level of particular departments, programs or practices. This combination of approaches reflects the highly decentralized nature of the university as well as the complex and contested idea of sustainability as an organizing principle for higher education. At UNH, sustainability leadership, ownership, and accountability have to be distributed rather than centralized while at the same time networked and coordinated to set and achieve overarching goals.\r\n\r\nSustainability planning at UNH is supported by: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tA conceptual framework linking principles and practices of sustainability to core university functions. This framework integrates the interactions of four key systems -- climate and energy, biodiversity and ecosystems, food systems, and culture -- with four key functions of the university known by the acronym CORE: curriculum, operations, research, and engagement. \r\n\u2022\tA programmatic entity whose structure, function and responsibilities are aligned with the CORE/systems conceptual framework \u2013 the UNH Sustainability Academy (UNSHA). UNHSA has full time staff, faculty fellows, student interns and collaborative networks across and beyond the university.\r\n\u2022\tAn administrative structure designed to support the articulation of goals and their implementation across the CORE \u2013 the UNHSA Collaborative Council. The Collaborative Council of the UNH Sustainability Academy brings together senior administrators in the areas of the CORE including research center directors as well as Inclusive Excellence, Communications and Marketing, and University Advancement, with faculty fellows and staff.\r\n\u2022\tSuccessful projects and programs that provide tangible experiences and examples for members of the UNH community to \u201cexperience\u201d sustainability and be inspired to find their unique way of contributing. A relatively comprehensive view of the dozens of examples in place at UNH is provided by the 2009 publication The Sustainable Learning Community: One University's Journey to the Future, an edited volume with contributions from more than sixty UNH faculty and staff.\r\n\r\nThis sustainability strategic planning document brings all of this planning, thinking and work together into one living document.  It is a starting point and a suggested guide for the university\u2019s investments of time and resources in sustainability over the next five years \u2013 investments done under the broad umbrella of the UNHSA but undertaken across campus collaboratively. The goal is to link key efforts across the university and beyond into a collaborative network that makes the whole of the interactions of these effort far greater than their sum. Given the amount of sustainability planning taking place, the potential is enormous. For example, this planning document reflects then work of hundreds of people as part of the following reports, planning efforts, task forces, committees, etc:\r\n\r\n \r\n\u2022\t\u201cSustainability: Extending the UNH Commitment,\u201d part of UNH\u2019s \u201cBreaking Silos, Transforming Lives, Reimagining UNH\u201d strategic plan (2010)\r\n\u2022\tCampus Master Plan\r\n\u2022\tCarbon Solutions New England\r\n\u2022\tCollege of Health and Human Services Vision and Strategic Intentions\r\n\u2022\tCollege of Life Sciences and Agriculture (COLSA) Strategic Plan \r\n\u2022\tCollege of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS) Strategic Plan 2009-2011\r\n\u2022\tCooperative Extension Strategic Plan\r\n\u2022\tDiversity Strategic Plan 2004-2009\r\n\u2022\tEnergy Task Force (ETF)\r\n\u2022\tEcosystem Task Force (EcoTF)\r\n\u2022\tFood Solutions New England\r\n\u2022\tGreenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories\r\n\u2022\tHealthy UNH\r\n\u2022\tIntegrated Waste Management Report\r\n\u2022\tLands Committee\r\n\u2022\tLandscaping Master Plan\r\n\u2022\tPlanning, Design & Construction Guidelines\r\n\u2022\tSTARS - Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System\r\n\u2022\tNH Farm to School Strategic Plan\r\n\u2022\tSustainability Research Collaboratory\r\n\u2022\tTransportation Policy Committee\r\n\u2022\tUNH Academic Plan\r\n\u2022\tUNH Discovery Program Report of the General Education Study Committee (2002)\r\n\u2022\tUNH Engagement and Outreach\r\n\u2022\tUNH Research Mission and Activities\r\n\u2022\tUNH Sustainability Communications Plan\r\n\u2022\tWhittemore School of Business & Economics Strategic Plan (2009)\r\n\u2022\tWildCAP, Climate Action Plan \r\n \r\nThis planning document will be constantly updated and informed by continual cross-campus collaboration through the UNHSA Collaborative Council, four UNH task forces in biodiversity/ecosystems, climate/energy, food and culture, UNSHA faculty fellows and staff, and the UNH community more broadly. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we encourage your thoughts and feedback at sustainability.info@unh.edu.",

The Sustainability Internship Program (SIP) is a collaborative effort between the University Office of Sustainability and the University Advising and Career Center to provide students with outside-the-classroom learning about sustainability while gaining valuable hands-on experience in the workforce. Since its formation in 2008, SIP has been responding to the global challenges of today by mentoring the leaders of tomorrow. By participating in SIP, students also make great networking connections. The Program is open to all UNH students from all majors. Previous SIP-employer partnerships range from Carbon Solutions New England to Clean Air-Cool Planet, the Green Alliance to Seacoast Eat Local, The USDA Forest Service to the University Office of Sustainability, NH Department of Environmental Services to NH Businesses for Social Responsibility, and many more. Using a learning community model, SIP students come together three times during the semester for roundtable discussions to share their experiences, interact with guest speakers with expertise on sustainability, watch films, and reflect on readings selected by SIP coordinators. Throughout their internship experience, SIP students also share and reflect on their experiences by blogging on the SIP blog (www.unhinterns.com). Finally, students summarize their SIP experience by presenting to employers, fellow SIP/UNH students, faculty, friends, and family at the annual Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) at UNH. Upon successful completion of SIP, students are awarded a letter of recommendation from UNH\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer Tom Kelly. \r\n\r\n2. UNH Carsey Institute Social Innovation Internship Program\r\n\r\nUN's 8-week Social Innovation Internship: (1) connects students to leading for-profit and nonprofit organizations for a rigorous and meaningful summer internship; (2) provides UNH training in social entrepreneurship; (3) supports students to mobilize their peers when they return to campus in the fall.  All this, along with a $2300 stipend!\r\n\r\nInternship sites include:\r\n\r\nCCA Global Partners (online platform for nonprofits)\r\nHolase (engineering)\r\nMoJo, a.k.a. Moms & Jobs (operations)\r\nMore than Wheels (social media strategy)\r\nNew Hampshire Community Loan Fund (small business prospect loan pipeline)\r\nPax World (sustainability research)\r\nRevolution Energy, a Green Launching Pad winner (marketing/education)\r\nROC USA (marketing)\r\nStonyfield Farm\r\n",

Coming from Waste Management\u2019s Turnkey Recycling and Environmental Enterprise (TREE) facility in Rochester, NH, the landfill gas replaces commercial natural gas as the primary fuel in UNH\u2019s cogeneration plant. Construction began in 2007 on the landfill gas processing plant in Rochester that purifies the gas and on the 12.7-mile underground pipeline that transports the gas from the plant to the UNH Durham campus.\r\n\r\nThe methane is the primary fuel to operate the university\u2019s cogeneration plant, which provides electricity and heat for the main campus buildings. UNH is the first university in the country to use landfill gas as its primary fuel source. When fully operational, EcoLine will provide up to 85% of the campus energy from the landfill gas. EcoLine cost an estimated $49 million - all internally-funded - with an anticipated payback within 10 years of the project. The sale of Renewable Energy Certificates generate by EcoLine helps to finance the project as well as support campus energy efficiency projects.\r\n",

The farm offers a platform for experimentation and education in many disciplines and allows for rigorous, transparent and replicable development and testing of scientific ideas, new methods, tools, and other new technologies.\r\n\r\nThe research priorities are relevant to both organic and conventional farm operations that are interested in lower input and/or sustainable production practices.\r\n\r\nAn inherent part of the Organic Dairy Research Farm\u2019s mission is the opportunity to provide outstanding research experiences to graduate and undergraduate students.  Students are often engaged through formal UNH courses that use the Farm as a living laboratory for class projects and as a field trip destination. \r\n\r\nProducers, suppliers and citizens also benefit.  Local farmers have access to tools and data generated at the farm to help assess the factors involved in sustainable agriculture.  Agricultural suppliers may collaborate on projects to test feeds, equipment, management methods and technologies. \r\n\r\nA byproduct of the farm is the organic milk that is sold on contract to distributors who are meeting the local demand for organic milk-based and other products.\r\n",

A high level of interactivity, hands-on learning and engagement is part of every training program.  Students learn the basics of sustainability issues, resources and statistics from subject area experts from the Office of Physical Plant (OPP), Auxiliary and Business Services and various academic colleges.  For excample, they learn about the types and amount of energy used at Penn State University Park from OPP energy engineers. The Eco-Reps learn the strategies and tools of effective behavior change using as a foundation the principles of community-based social marketing. Teambuilding training is also offered to get the Eco-Reps working effectively together and with others. Throughout the school year Eco-Reps receive training from Penn State leaders and take educational tours like a tour of the the community waste authority and the campus recycling tour. \r\nTraining is based on the theme or issue of each semester.

Waste audits are done in the various halls and the area with the least amount of recyclables in the trash at the end of 7 days wins the challenge.

            "value": "The Penn State Strategic Plan \"Priorities for Excellence\" emphasizes both the external--economic development in the community and state--and internal--operational cost reduction, total cost of ownership considerations--economic dimensions of sustainability by placing it in several areas.  Two examples are sustainability's place in Penn State's proud tradition of public service and outreach:\r\n\r\n\"As part of its land-grant mission, Penn State serves the people of the Commonwealth in a role that\r\nis far larger than simply educating its citizens in the University\u2019s classrooms. . .This mission is crucial to Penn State, but in tough economic times, the nature of the mission will need to be adapted because of the changing\r\nnature of financial support, new technologies for delivery, and the desire to include more areas of the University to address the Commonwealth\u2019s increasingly complex social, economic, and environmental challenges.\"\r\n\r\nThis strategic priority has already manifested in a number of leading online and in-person credit and non-credit courses delivered via Continuing Education and World Campus, energy and environmental services provided by the Small Business Development Center, alternative energy assistance and sustainable agriculture training provided by Cooperative Extension, and award-winning programming produced by WPSU TV and radio including Liquid Assets, a nationally recognized documentary about the United States' aging water infrastructure.  These are just some examples of how Penn State actively engages with the economic dimension of sustainability for and with our external customers and partners.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL\r\nSustainability sits squarely in one of the main seven strategic goals in the plan.  An excerpt below from the section \"Goal 7: Control Costs and Generate Additional Efficiencies\" explains the university's goal and commitment to the economic dimensions of sustainability:\r\n\r\nINTERNAL\r\n\"7.8 Strategy: Establish and Foster Sustainable Environments\r\nAction: \r\n\r\nThe increasing pressures on global resources and environmental conditions make it imperative that Penn State embrace sustainability in its many dimensions in ways\r\nthat would position the University as a leader nationally and internationally. The University can demonstrate its leadership in terms of the incorporation of sustainability in its educational programs, in its research and knowledge creation about global issues surrounding sustainability, and in operating its multitude of facilities across the Commonwealth. In keeping with the theme of prioritization\r\nand excellence, strategies to embrace sustainability efforts are offered with the expectation that short-term investments will be necessary but that they can lead to\r\nlong-term savings.  The current economic and environmental crises affecting a wide range of everyday existence for most of the Penn State community and its constituencies provide a platform from which responses can consider the impacts on sustainability. Energy and the environment are two critically important dimensions of sustainability, but\r\nthere are far more dimensions that can be considered.\r\nPenn State has been a leader in many aspects of sustainability education and operations from its support for the Center for Sustainability to its purchases of\r\ngreen power. The University benefits greatly from cooperation among many academic and administrative units in making these advances possible. There are numerous academic-administrative partnerships with students and researchers in\r\nareas such as emission reduction and the efficient use and conservation of resources. Also, Finance & Business has earned multiple awards in the area of environmental stewardship, with programs such as the use of biofuels in its service fleet, adoption of a new LEED policy for all new buildings, reductions in the University\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, encouraging bicycle use, an increased\r\nrecycling effort that already has resulted in 57 percent recycling rate of all Penn State municipal solid\r\nwaste, and much more.\"",

A Campus Master Plan was developed for University Park in 1999 and additional master plans for other campus locations have been developed and continue to be developed.  \r\n\r\nThe comments below address how sustainability was integrated into the University Park Campus Master Plan.  The following goals speak directly to the university's inclusion of sustainability in our physical campus planning at a high level:\r\n\r\n\"1.3.3 Protection and Extension of Open Space Quality\r\n\r\nWhile the core campus has historically been identified with an attractive and memorable landscape of broad lawns and mature shade trees, the perimeter areas of the campus lack these same placemaking characteristics. There is a need to improve the overall image of the campus by expanding the orderly open space structure of the core campus to include the campus perimeter areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3.4 Response to Environmental Constraints\r\n\r\nGiven the increasing pressures of continued growth on the local environment, it is important that the University plan its facilities in a manner that responds appropriately to the need to protect the quality of surface waters, the University well system, and the natural environment.\"\r\n\r\nMuch of the above is being accomplished through the designation of Environmentally Sensitive Areas that include groundwater recharge areas, natural heritage areas, and green space.  We have mapped these areas and they are shown here: http://www.opp.psu.edu/about-opp/divisions/cpd/images/s-5-3%20Environ-1.pdf\r\n",

These initiatives, presently in variable stages of maturity and scale, serve as programs that inform core pedagogical design and sustainability assessment criteria that are applied across the university, most recently as criteria and learning objectives that have been included in the STARS curriculum assessment.\r\n                                   \r\nThe American Indian Housing Initiative \u2013 Multi-semester, multi-course with laboratory\r\n            The American Indian Housing Initiative (AIHI) is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort to engage students, volunteers and tribal partners in sustainable building methods and technologies, concepts of sustainability, and home energy usage on American Indian reservations. Entering its eleventh year at Penn State, this culturally rich and socially relevant immersive educational exchange is carried out with a number of partnerships, centering on our decade-long relationship with the Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe.  The AIHI program is offered to students of all ages and disciplines at Penn State as a three-part (prepare-act-reflect) course series.  In the spring, students are introduced to Native American culture, history and current economics in tandem with a hands-on study of sustainable building methods and technologies, home energy leadership and construction project planning.  This preparation is followed by a two-week immersive summer experience workshop on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana, where students participate in community-based sustainable construction projects.  The reflective component during the fall semester allows students to document, reflect on and assess the project and the experience, and make suggestions for future projects.  AIHI also provides opportunities for students from other universities and for volunteers. Please see our website for more information.   www.cfs.psu.edu/programs/aihi\r\n                                   \r\nRenewable Energy for Central America (RECA)  - Single-semester course with laboratory\r\n            Renewable Energy for Central America, (RECA) is a national program developed at Penn State in partnership with the National Electrical Contractors Association to foster clean energy solutions in communities of Central America.  The research and educational objectives are to provide students with hands-on experiences in the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems in Central American communities for which this technology is appropriate.  An additional objective is the cultivation of community expertise in the installation and maintenance of solar energy systems.  RECA was launched in March 2009 through a pilot program, \u201cRenew Crew,\u201d in which students prepared for the installation of a 2.5kW solar photovoltaic system in Roat\u00e1n, Honduras.  Now in its third year at Penn State, the program is being adopted by the University of Kansas and California Polytechnic Institute, San Lius Obispo who are developing sister RECA programs in Belize and Costa Rica respectively.  http://www.cfs.psu.edu/programs/renewcrew.html\r\n                                   \r\nParks, People, Places South Africa \u2013 Single-semester course with laboratory\r\n            This is a ten-week, 15-credit program that takes place in the Dwesa-Cwebe nature reserve of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Entering its third year at Penn State, the program encompasses disciplines ranging from earth sciences, ecology and land use management to community relations, livelihood assessment, indigenous knowledge systems and entrepreneurship. It brings together the natural and social sciences in projects that address issues of community and human development, environmental protection and health, water, food and energy security as these relate to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Penn State students travel to South Africa, take classes, and conduct research and service projects in the parks and in the communities that surround them. During the ten weeks, Penn State students are joined at different times by students and staff from several partner universities in South Africa, as well as by nature reserve staff and local community members. The program is directed by Penn State faculty and courses are taught by Penn State faculty, in collaboration with South African faculty. http://gpglobalea.gp.psu.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=10228&Type=O&sType=O\r\n                                   \r\nSustainability Research in Jamaica \u2013 Summer multi-course with laboratory first-year student LEAP program \r\n            Penn State's Learning Edge Academic Program (LEAP) offers an introduction to college life for students who wish to take courses during the six-week summer session before their first year in college.  Each student's schedule consists of two courses (1: either first-year English composition or the introductory public speaking course and 2: a second course from another academic discipline).  Instructors for the two courses plan them together, and the composition or public speaking assignments reflect the content of the second course.  In the summer of 2011, LEAP, for the first time, offered a sustainability course pairing that included a field trip to Jamaica for service learning projects in sustainability.  In addition to class projects, students travel to the island of Jamaica for 14 days, to live in a self-sustaining community and to work on sustainability-related research and service learning projects along with Penn State faculty and local collaborators. While exploring sustainability concepts and applications, students develop skills in rhetoric and composition.  They are asked to delve into the arguments that scientists, advisors, legislators, policy makers, reporters and others make regarding the controversies over environmental protection, economic development, and the associated costs to society.  In the process, they wade through complex and numerous dissenting viewpoints.  \r\nhttp://www.leap.psu.edu/leap_prides.htm   --  See LEAP 097.240 Sustainability Research in Jamaica\r\n",

A 50 percent reduction in energy use in buildings would have the equivalent effect of taking every car and small truck in the U.S. off the road! \r\n\r\nThe Greater Philadelphia Innovation Cluster (GPIC) for Energy Efficient Buildings was established in February 2011 with funding from four federal agencies and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The goals of the GPIC are to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Transform building retrofit industry from serial fragmentation to integrated systems methods;\r\n\u2022 Provide usable tools and technologies that can reduce energy use in buildings by 50 percent; \r\n\u2022 Stimulate private investment and quality job creation in Greater Philadelphia and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe strategic focus of the GPIC is on full-spectrum energy efficient retrofit of average size commercial and multi-family residential buildings.  GPIC metrics are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Energy Efficiency: Annual energy savings per square foot of space;\r\n\u2022 Scalability: Affordability of energy efficiency technologies and systems;\r\n\u2022 Quality of Life: Safety and health of energy efficient building indoor environments;\r\n\u2022 Regional Transformation: Change in building industry operations and cluster development;\r\n\u2022 Economic Development: New jobs created or retained in energy efficient retrofit industry.\r\n\r\nThe location for the GPIC is the Navy Yard in Philadelphia.  The Navy Yard includes 270 existing and new buildings that can be utilized as test beds, and an independent unregulated micro-grid being developed as a resource for development and demonstration smart-grid technologies.  The 23 GPIC member organizations are organized into six task groups:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Design Tools: Develop and deliver integrated processes, computational tools, software, and simulation environment for energy-efficient building system design;\r\n\u2022 Integrated Technologies: Develop new component technologies including innovative envelopes, power generation and storage technologies, new lighting systems, and robust control and diagnostic systems and scalable systems solutions for full spectrum retrofits;\r\n\u2022 Policy, Markets, and Behavior: Discover the optimal mix of incentives, mandates, and automation to achieve energy efficiency in buildings and design policy instruments that flexibly deploy in cities and states to achieve energy efficiency;\r\n\u2022 Education and Workforce Development: Develop skills in energy efficient building systems at all levels, including solar, smart grid, building energy efficiency auditing, integrated design and project management;\r\n\u2022 Deployment and Commercialization: Provide funding and other commercialization assistance and market discoveries that inventing GPIC member organizations elect not to commercialize themselves;\r\n\u2022 Collaborative Demonstrations: GPIC technologies, systems, and methods will be demonstrated via retrofit projects in Greater Philadelphia including Building 661 a full-spectrum energy efficient building retrofit at the Navy Yard.",
