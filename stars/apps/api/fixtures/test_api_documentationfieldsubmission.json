In 2003, UCLA developed campus green building and operational guidelines modeled on LEED and Labs21. Documentation and credit requirements were nearly identical to those systems, but adapted to reflect Campus circumstances. Review and validation of compliance was by UCLA Campus Building Officials and the Office of the Campus Architect.  Since 2009, the UC policy has required all eligible new construction to achieve LEED certification at the Silver Level, certified through the USGBC and GBCI. The policy also includes requirements for sustainable operations. Implementation of LEED EBOM began with the preparation of a campus EBOM pilot project. At UCLA, this was the Public Affairs Building, which was Silver certified by the USGBC.  \r\n\r\nAdditional links:\r\n\r\nAppendix 2, Feasibility Study for a Green Building Policy : http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sustainability/documents/gbfeasibility.pdf\r\n   \r\nAppendix 3, Feasibility Study for a Clean Energy Standard:  http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sustainability/documents/cefeasibility.pdf  \r\n\r\nUCLA 2006 Update to Green Building Policy:  http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/media/files/ucregentgreenbldg.pdf    \r\n\r\nClimate Action Plan: http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/cap/          \r\n\r\nCurrent UC Policy on Sustainable Practices and Policy Guidelines: http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sustainability/documents/policy_sustain_prac.pdf     \r\n\r\nUCLA Housing and Hospitality Sustainability Strategic Plan: http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/media/files/zSustStratPlan_5-20-09.pdf \r\n\r\nSustainability Charter: http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/media/files/Sustainability-Charter.pdf \r\n\r\nUCLA Energy Conservation: http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.789d0eb6c76e7ef0d66b02ddf848344a/?vgnextoid=a9db26a6486f6110VgnVCM100000e1d76180RCRD  \r\n\r\nUCLA Green Purchasing Policy: http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.789d0eb6c76e7ef0d66b02ddf848344a/?vgnextoid=b1d700e0fdfd1010VgnVCM1000008f8443a4RCRD \r\n\r\nUCLA Water Conservation: http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/get_involved/article.asp?parentid=261 \r\n\r\nUCLA Waste Reduction and Recycling: http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.789d0eb6c76e7ef0d66b02ddf848344a/?vgnextoid=615355fb84eb6110VgnVCM100000e1d76180RCRD \r\n\r\nUCLA indoor air quality and environmental impact management: http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.2bceb61fc98129c1ae13e110f848344a/?vgnextoid=871082df180e1110VgnVCM100000dcd76180RCRD\r\n\r\nBruin Green Cleaning Program: http://sustain.ucla.edu/campus/article.asp?parentid=11164\r\n\r\nCurrent UC Policy on Sustainable Practices and Policy Guidelines, Sep-2009\r\n\r\nThe Public Affairs Building (201667 sf) was certified by the USGBC as a LEED-EB (Existing Building) Silver rated building renovation in January, 2009. The building earned 45 LEED-EB points.This was a pilot LEED Existing Building project for UCLA, which turned out quite successfully. The renovation of this existing building, and the LEED certification process was handled by UCLA's Facilities Management, as are all renovation projects. One of the biggest changes to the Public Affairs Building was a new heating, cooling and ventilation system, according to Robert Striff, a senior energy engineer in Facilities Management's Energy Services who helped guide the process. \"This is a 50-year-old building,\" Striff said. \"It didn't have an efficient heating and cooling system, so when we converted it to the most efficient system possible, given the building's size constraints, that made a big difference.\" Everything about the Public Affairs Building is now metered \u2013 the water for plumbing, the chilled water for cooling, the electricity for lights, the steam for heating \u2013 so it's easy to measure progress, Striff added. Facilities Management also added features occupancy sensors for the lights and ultra-low-flush urinals. A pre-existing white roof, which reflects heat from sunlight and lessens the need for air-conditioning, also helped the Public Affairs Building snag a good LEED score. Green practices that were already in place also helped, Facilities Management's Energy Services Engineer, Paul Butapetch said.\r\n\r\n* (Above quotes from \"Building's Green Makeover Wins High Score UC-Wide\"; http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/building-s-green-makeover-wins-94602.aspx)",

Since then, the UC has gained further national recognition by demonstrating the unique role that higher education can play in addressing sustainability issues.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 2009-2010 Capital Financial Plan, UCLA utilizes a variety of methods to ensure that the issue of environmental sustainability is addressed. The UC Sustainability Policy addresses sustainability and green buildings on the UC campuses. The Policy sets aggressive goals for the ten UC campuses to continue to reduce their carbon footprints. These goals represent a challenge for UCLA as the campus expands and demand for energy increases (through growth in the use of technology). Incorporating energy efficiency into new buildings and renovations as part of the Green Building Program has allowed UCLA to continue to reduce the amount of energy used on a square-foot basis, despite overall campus growth. All UCLA projects are designed to comply with the requirements of the Policy. The Policy adopts green building standards using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system and includes stringent energy conservation measures. UCLA is committed to achieving a minimum LEED Silver certification for all new construction and major renovation projects.\r\n\r\nAbove from http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/regents/regmeet/jul09/gb3attach.pdf)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in the Capital Financial Plan, \"Build A Sustainable Campus\" is one of three major Capital Strategic Initiatives. The plan details green building, transportation, energy conservation and other sustainability programs and goals. One of the other strategic initiatives- \"Transform UCLA to a Residential Academic Community\" is also related to sustainability, as increasing the amount of students and staff living on campus decreases commutes and builds community. \r\n\r\n2009-2010 Capital Financial Plan: http://www.ucop.edu/capitalprojects/documents/cfp09-10/la.pdf\r\n\r\nUCLA's Strategic Plan clearly addresses pertinent environmental issues and provides a framework to guide UCLA to implement environmentally friendly building technologies and energy efficient design strategies.

The UC Policy set three climate change goals for the 10 UC campuses:\r\n\u2022Reduction in campus emissions to year 2000 levels by 2014;\r\n\u2022Reduction in campus emissions to year 1990 levels by 2020; and\r\n\u2022Attainment of climate neutrality as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThese goals are in parallel with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Assembly Bill 32) and based on the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, which the UC President and the UC Council of Chancellor\u2019s signed, joining university leaders across the country. The UC policy also calls for UC campuses to draft a Climate Action Plan (CAP) that examines the feasibility of meeting these goals. \r\n\r\nUCLA has a decades-long history of pursuing sustainable practices in campuswide operations and has established extensive academic, research, and community outreach programs in climate change and sustainability. By building upon past achievements, UCLA's Climate Action Plan (CAP) outlines a comprehensive range of initiatives to advance campus sustainable practices and further reduce UCLA\u2019s carbon footprint. The UCLA Climate Action Plan addresses carbon emission reduction initiatives including behavioral change, energy use and conservation, student and workforce commutes, and air travel. The Climate Action Plan also examines the feasibility of these initiatives and determines a target for UCLA greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Every initiative that is implemented moves the campus closer to achieving the ultimate goal of climate neutrality.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the system-wide emission reduction targets, UCLA has set the following targets specific to transportation: \r\n  \r\n  *     Increase number of PZEV/ZV/ATPZEV Fleet vehicles by 20% by 2010\r\n    *     Increase number of PZEV/ZV/ATPZEV Fleet vehicles by 40% by 2014\r\n    *     Increase number of PZEV/ZV/ATPZEV Fleet vehicles by 70% by 2020\r\n    *     Estimated that entire campus Fleet will run on non-carbon based fuel by 2050\r\n    *     Reduce employee single occupant vehicle ridership to 50%\r\n    *     Maintain employee single occupant vehicle at 50% with anticipated population growth\r\n    *     Reduce faculty/staff air travel by 5% by 2020 ",

The plan was authored by members of the UCLA Sustainability Committee, founded in 2005 and made up of students, staff and faculty that help catalyze and prioritize sustainability initiatives on campus.  The plan catalogues the steps the University has taken in the past and contains a detailed financial feasibility analysis for the initiatives the University will undertake in energy and transportation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).\r\n\r\nThis Climate Action Plan considers initiatives that focus on reductions in GHG emissions from stationary source energy use (i.e. Cogeneration Plant and purchased utilities) and emissions from mobile sources (campus fleet vehicles, commutes, and air travel). The GHG reduction initiatives described in this CAP fall into three main categories:\r\n\r\n\u2022energy use reduction and efficiency;\r\n\u2022mobility \u2013 reduction in vehicle miles traveled and utilization of alternative transportation modes; and\r\n\u2022behavioral changes aimed at influencing individual and institutional choices related to energy use and mobility.\r\n\r\nEnergy initiatives include building system upgrades that improve efficiency of heating and cooling equipment, installation of more energy efficient lighting systems, and inclusion of \u201cgreen\u201d power and solar energy in the campus\u2019 energy portfolio. Improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings and pursuing alternative energy sources will result in a significant reduction in the GHG emissions of the campus.\r\n\r\nTransportation initiatives will increase the number of clean and alternative fuel fleet vehicles, reduce single-occupant commutes to campus, and possibly establish an emissions mitigation fund for air travel, all of which would contribute to a substantial emission reduction potential.\r\n\r\nThis Climate Action Plan also recognizes that behavior change is at the core of many of UCLA\u2019s proposed initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Behavioral change toward more sustainable practices, though difficult to quantify in terms of emissions reduction, is inherent in all GHG emission reduction initiatives. Provision of sustainability education awareness in campus operations continues to positively influence areas such as recycling, purchasing, housing, dining, as well as energy and water conservation. With engagement and support from the Campus Sustainability Committee and a full-time campus sustainability coordinator, a \u201cculture of sustainability\u201d is emerging campuswide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these initiatives, academic and research initiatives addressed in this Climate Action Plan will have an enduring benefit by creating new technologies and training students to become leaders in addressing challenges of global climate change for years to come.",

By definition, sustainability requires a multi-disciplinary perspective.  The LiS program allows students to create a program tailored to their needs and background, by choosing among the sustainability related courses and opportunities at UCLA.  Students take a core course in sustainability and relevant electives and participate in leadership training. Additionally, students have a positive impact on the community as they learn experientially by collaborating on client projects for local businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies. LiS students also give themselves a career edge by developing a broad knowledge of topics that are increasingly relevant to employers. The program is open to all graduate students at UCLA (masters and doctoral) and is offered with no additional fees.\r\n\r\nThe program first started in the Anderson School of Management and has been administered by the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability since 2009.  The program has been quite successful with 85+ graduates so far and more than 160 students currently enrolled representing more than 30 different programs as diverse as Anderson School of Management, School of Law, Luskin School of Public Affairs, School of Public Health, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, School of Arts & Architecture, School of Nursing, and numerous departments in the College of Letters and Science including Asian Languages and Cultures, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Chemistry, Geography and others.\r\n\r\nStudents are required to take four courses (16+ units of study) and complete a Leadership Project: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Leaders in Sustainability core course (4 units): Introduction to the concept of sustainability and the leadership skills students will need to make a positive impact on their chosen dimension of sustainability.  This class combines environmental, social and economic perspectives in a wide range of contexts, using a mix of class formats to bring out the unique multidisciplinary nature of the audience.\r\n\r\n\u2022 3 or more additional graduate-level courses: (at least 12 units, or equivalent in semester units): Students select courses from economics, engineering, environment, law, management, natural sciences, public health, public policy, social sciences, and urban planning, among others.  At least one of these three courses must be outside a student\u2019s home school.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Sustainability Leadership project: All students must complete a project related to sustainability (may be part of the students\u2019 regular departmental graduation requirements). Examples of past projects include:\r\n  o starting a nonprofit organization with UCLA alums, called the Los Angeles Sustainability Collaborative, that funds graduate students to conduct research on issues of environmental sustainability;\r\n  o co-organization of the annual California Clean Innovation conference;\r\n  o  serving as Editor in Chief of the UCLA Journal of Environmental Law and Policy;\r\n  o helping initiate, plan, and implement the first Bicycle and Pedestrian Count for the City of Los Angeles to gauge how infrastructure is being used to measure changes over time.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the formal requirements of the certificate program, all students are encouraged to participate actively in relevant events organized by the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability and other units, including seminars, conferences, etc.\r\n\r\nThe LiS program was recently awarded the 2010 Dr. Alfred and Lynn Manos Page Prize for Sustainability Issues in Business Curricula. The Page Prize encourages efforts to expose business students to state-of-the-art environmental sustainability knowledge.\r\n\r\n",

At UCLA, the program is supported and administered by the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability (IoES).\r\n\r\nThe ESLP program consists of three components that are all student-led; a speaker series, a film series and Action Research Teams (ART).  The speaker series and ART are taken for course credit through the IoES (Environment 185A/B/C) and may apply towards the Environmental Systems and Society minor offered by the Institute. \r\n\r\nThrough the ART component of the program, students form research teams to tackle issues of campus sustainability including energy efficiency, transportation, waste stream management, sustainable food practices and more. The goal of ART is to generate a coalition of student researchers that, together with faculty members and UCLA staff, strives to make UCLA a model campus and national leader in sustainability.  Each ART team is comprised of two team leaders, 3-6 team members, and a UCLA faculty or staff member that serves as the project stakeholder. The stakeholder is responsible for helping students target their research by serving as a mentor as well as acting as a liaison by offering logistical support and advice on behalf of the University\u2019s interests.  \r\n\r\nOver the course of two quarters, winter and spring, students are expected to frame their research topic, develop a hypothesis and research plan, compile and analyze data, complete a 15-20 page group report on their findings, and present their results at an event open to all UCLA faculty, staff and students.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire process, students meet with their stakeholders to continually refine their research and identify targets of possible change through new information gained from action research. The two-quarter time frame allows for an in-depth journey that enables a thorough analysis of the research project.  The ART projects provide campus stakeholders with invaluable information they would not otherwise have the capacity to gather.  All participants work together to make UCLA more sustainable, which also contributes to creating a sense of community on campus.\r\n\r\nART has impacted many sectors of campus by tackling a wide range of topics including: food systems and dining hall waste, overhaul of campus waste and recycling system, greening laboratories, mapping trees on campus, residence hall energy metering to affect behavior, hospital initiatives, greening the Greek system, drought-tolerant landscaping, curriculum assessment and enhancement, recreational facilities, paperless course evaluations, promoting fair trade products, educating student groups on being sustainable, and more.         \r\n\r\nTo date, over 170 students from more than 30 different departments have contributed thousands of hours toward making UCLA more sustainable and many teams have helped to save money, energy, water and carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nFunding for ESLP has been generously provided by the Dart Foundation, ASUCLA\u2019s The Green Initiative Fund and the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability.

In September 2010, all UCLA campus shuttle routes including Campus Express, Wilshire Express, Northwest Shuttle and the University Apartments began to report \u201clive\u201d predictive bus arrival information on the web at www.bruinbus.ucla.edu.  This new technology lets users know where the next BruinBus is and when it will arrive.  Users can check bus arrivals via landline, cell phone, web-enabled device or computer to find the next BruinBus. BruinBus real-time tracking will also be included in the release of the UCLA Mobile Web http://m.ucla.edu.\r\n\r\nUCLA Fleet and Transit is providing this predictive arrival system which utilizes satellite technology and advanced computer modeling to track bus movement and stop patterns on the respective routes of all UCLA campus shuttle buses. The system triangulates designated stops and traffic patterns with actual bus locations to predict when the next BruinBus will arrive with an accuracy of within 1-2 minutes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe use of real-time technology is designed to better serve the University community and increase bus availability,\u201d said Maria Collins, UCLA Transit Manager. \u201cNot only will this put us at the forefront of the use of smart bus technology, but it will connect us directly with our customers.\u201d\r\n\r\nEach of the BruinBus stops around campus will display a designated bus stop code, a telephone number and a web link for real-time tracking. Riders simply go to the website or call the telephone number and enter the bus stop code to determine how many minutes before the arrival of the next two BruinBuses. Frequent users can simply program the number into their phone to quickly call whenever needed or set up alerts to automatically notify them of bus arrivals at a specific time.  Instead of repeatedly requesting arrival times, the user can simply set an alert for a specific stop daily.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis new system doesn\u2019t make the BruinBuses faster or more frequent, but there is something empowering about knowing you have time to grab a cup of coffee or tea before the next bus,\u201d said Collins.\r\n\r\nUCLA\u2019s annual one million plus BruinBus riders can now plan to arrive at the bus stop within moments of a bus\u2019 actual arrival time.  No more needless standing at a bus stop during inclement weather or after dark waiting for the bus to arrive.  And the time spent waiting at a shuttle stop wondering if you just missed the bus or how soon the next bus is coming will now be a thing of the past. This real-time technology will enable UCLA Fleet and Transit to deliver a more efficient shuttle program and will \u201cKeep UCLA Moving!\u201d ",

            "value": "Bruin Bikes Program\r\n\r\nThe UCLA Bruin Bikes Program was first launched in 2008, at the inaugural UCLA Sustainability Fair, and was the beginning of a series of incremental improvements in order to grow bicycle ridership on the UCLA campus. UCLA Transportation originally purchased 14 bicycles, five of which were provided to the UCLA Guest House and Tiverton House. The other nine bicycles were provided to different departments on campus. The bicycles provided for the UCLA Guest House and Tiverton House are available for visiting guests to check-out, free of charge, while staying at UCLA. Guests can use the bicycles for their transportation needs or for leisure rides around campus and into the adjacent Westwood Village. The bicycles provided for the departments are intended for employees to use as an alternative to departmental vehicles, in order to run short errands around UCLA. \r\n\r\nBy 2009, more departments on campus were interested in participating in the Bruin Bikes Program. Through funding provided by the UCLA FITWELL Program, UCLA Transportation and UCLA Recreation were able to procure an additional 24 bicycles. Seventeen bicycles were provided to departments on campus, and the additional seven bicycles replaced an outdated bicycle fleet that the UCLA Bike Shop rents for daily and weekly rates. Through the partnership with UCLA FITWELL, \u2018active sustainability\u2019 was coined. Active sustainability can be described as matching personal healthy living with better sustainability practices. \r\n\r\nBy 2010, another branch grew out of the Bruin Bike\u2019s tree, the UCLA Bike Library. Through a grant awarded by The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF), UCLA Transportation and UCLA Recreation were able to purchase 50 bicycles and construct additional  storage space to operate the Bike Library. The Bike Library allows students to rent a bicycle for $35 per quarter. The Bike Library is ideal for students looking for an inexpensive bicycle for a temporary period. UCLA impounds close to 100 bicycles annually, many of which are abandoned by students who are enrolled with UCLA for a short period of time. \r\n\r\nUCLA Recreation has supported the Bruin Bikes Program since its inception. UCLA Recreation oversees the UCLA Bike Shop, which sells bicycle accessories, and performs light bicycle repairs. The UCLA Bike Shop is responsible for overseeing maintenance and repair of all the bikes that are part of the Bruin Bikes Program.",

            "value": "STAR4Defense certified painter training is a 3-day course for military spray technicians and is a program of the University of Northern Iowa\u2019s Iowa Waste Reduction Center (IWRC). Training is broken down into three processes: classroom, in the booth, and VirtualPaint. Classroom is covered over the first and second day. This includes all of the basic information about coatings, spray guns, and techniques among other topics. In the booth painting is done all three days. The first time painters are in the booth is for the transfer efficiency pre-test, then day two gives them time to improve techniques and practice before the last day transfer efficiency post-test.  STAR4D\u2019s primary objective for integrating virtual reality technology into the training program is to allow spray technicians a means of practicing proper spray techniques repeatedly before spraying actual coatings, without generating any hazardous wastes or emissions, while increasing efficiency.\r\n\r\nHundreds of painters have gone through the course and improved results have always been seen. STAR4Defense focuses on comprehensive knowledge of the entire painting process and improving spray techniques. With proper training with the new VirtualPaint training program, painters are able to reduce the amount of harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being released into the environment, the amount of paint wasted during application, and the time spent in the paint booth. Being able to correctly apply coating also reduces the time and effort of completing rework and improves corrosion protection.\r\n\r\nMore Benefits of VirtualPaint Training\r\n    * Completely eliminates hazardous air emissions and waste.\r\n    * Significantly reduces the environmental impacts.\r\n    * Precise feedback benefits experienced and novice painters, creating a shorter learning curve and greater transferability.\r\n    * Unlimited practice parts and coating at the touch of a button does not result in increased emissions and waste.\r\n\r\nBecause of the high demand for this new and innovative service, the IWRC has set up satellite sites and established more sites across the country to develop a skilled workforce focused on the safety of the Armed Forces. \r\n\r\nCurrent STAR4Defense satellite sites include:\r\n\u2022\tMarine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Calif.\r\n\u2022\tMarine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Ga.\r\n\u2022\tRobins Air Force Base, Ga.\r\n\u2022\tRock Island Arsenal, Ill.\r\n\u2022\tBlue Grass Army Depot, Ky.\r\n\u2022\tLetterkenny Army Depot, Pa.\r\n\u2022\tTobyhanna Army Depot, Pa.\r\n\u2022\tCorpus Christi Army Depot, Texas\r\n\u2022\tInter-American Air Forces Academy, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas\r\n",

As a result, they not only represent the UNI campus, but all campuses within the region that includes Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and Kansas.\r\n\r\nInitially the OnCampus ecoAmbassador devoted most of their time speaking with administration and facilities to understand challenges and goals UNI currently has for conserving energy, reducing waste, pesticide management and recycling. Part of their job has been to provide accolades for what UNI is currently doing in this regard, but also to innovate better ways to \u201cget the job done\u201d.  They have documented opportunities to increase composting of food waste, monitored results of tray-free dinning campaigns to save water and reduce detergent and food waste. UNI Grounds staff have enlisted the Eco ambassadors assistance do document the quantitative ways they reduce the application of pesticides on the campus to the result of a safer, greener campus. By doing so they have been able to quantify the highest possible pest threshold so staff understand thresholds for maintaining a beautiful campus in an environmentally friendly way. The OnCampus ecoAmbassador have been a valuable new addition to the many sustainable initiatives on the UNI campus and have created a partnership with the federal government that was not previously in place. \r\n",

Their team typically serves and advises economic development corporations, chambers of commerce, convention and visitors bureaus, community planning groups, and other similar groups and organizations.\r\n\r\nFrom March 2008 to March 2009, IDM worked with Mayor Ed Malloy, city officials, and community members from the city of Fairfield, Iowa to develop a community-wide sustainability plan.  The plan, published in 2009, lays out three main goals for the community and the steps to achieve these goals.  The three goals are:\r\n\u2022\tTo create and maintain the sustainability culture\r\n\u2022\tTo create jobs, wealth and opportunities for investment, with sustainable investment\r\n\u2022\tTo achieve sustainable community design and public policy and infrastructure\r\n\r\nNearly the entire community was involved in the development of the plan because of the use of the visioning and planning model implemented by IDM. Mayor Malloy and 19 other community members from all walks of life made up the Fairfield Sustainability Commission. More than 40 businesses and organizations were on board with the plan and offered their assistance. \r\n\r\nCommunities across Iowa are taking notice of Fairfield\u2019s innovative sustainability plan, and some are even looking to develop similar strategies. Fairfield\u2019s sustainability plan is paving the way for the future and setting an example for communities throughout the nation.\r\n",

We have three main goals.\r\n1. Raise Awareness: Education lays the foundation for campus sustainability. The more students know, the more effective they will be at creating positive change. We will spread our message by tabling, passing out information, showing films, and hosting debates.\r\n2. Foster Sustainable Behavior: Our core mission is to help students become more sustainable. Through extensive research and preparation, we will develop social marketing plans that address students concerns and motivations. We will show them how they can take a personal role in ensuring that future generations will have the same opportunities we have.\r\n3. Create Wider Change: Students have the power to create change beyond their own lives. With the help of outside organizations and businesses, we will give students a way to make a difference on a campus-wide scale. We will work to reduce the University of Florida\u2019s negative effects on climate, the environment, and society through innovative competitions and campaigns.\r\n",

This document is based on the EPA\u2019s Building Air Quality guide and on EPA\u2019s Tools for Schools IAQ management program guidelines.\r\nEach IAQ concern is entered into a log that notes the dates that the concern is received and evaluated, the location and the specific actions taken.\r\n\r\nIndoor air quality concerns are investigated by the Environmental Health and Safety Department (EH&S). An EH&S certified industrial hygienist acts as a central point of contact for IAQ issues. \r\n\r\nWith over 900 buildings on the University\u2019s Gainesville campus, it is not currently feasible to conduct an IAQ survey of each one. IAQ concerns are investigated on a case by case basis. General guidance on various IAQ issues is provided on the EH&S website (http://www.ehs.ufl.edu/IH/IEQ.htm).\r\n\r\nAn IAQ protocol with guidelines related to maximum limits for various comfort parameters in University buildings has been in place for several years. Since there are currently no regulations in effect covering indoor air quality in a non-industrial environment, we follow the recommendations of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). \r\n\r\nTraining on IAQ topics is available by request. \r\n",

Public events provided an opportunity to learn about sustainable food systems through keynote presentations, panel discussions, a fair featuring a farmers market, and a photography exhibit.  Additional programs hosted in the days leading up to the event, complimented the summit program, and included movie showings, student-led programs and community meetings.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, part of this event, a photography exhibit was developed to integrate the arts and interdisciplinary work into the FFS program.  Range, Furrow, and Grove was a collaboration between UF/IFAS, the Center for Public Issues Education, the UF Office of Sustainability, and the College of Fine Arts School of Art & Art History, with each collaborator contributing labor and financial support to the project.  This collaboration also included a curator, Dr. Kelly Wacker, from the University of Montevallo.  The exhibit, which displays both historic and current photography of Florida Agriculture was so well received by participants at the FFS that the collaboration has been extended and the collaborators are now working on the show to be exhibited in the Gallery for Innovation in the Arts from July 1 \u2013 September 30, 2011.  This gallery is located in Tallahassee, Florida, in the same building as the Florida Museum of History.  We\u2019ve also created a gallery guide to go along with the exhibit.  We expect to create a website for the exhibit and for the exhibit to travel to various galleries around the state. ",
