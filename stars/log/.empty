This file is only a placeholder in the stars/log subdirectory.  Log
files are going into stars/log, and it needs to exist before STARS
starts; adding it into the repository ensures it will be there.  Since
Mercurial tracks files, not directories, we can't add an empty
subdirectory to the repository.  So we add this file to the
subdirectory, then add it to the repository.
