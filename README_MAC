Python Environment
------------------

My experience is that the easiest setup is to use the homebrew package manager. This is because it's so hard to get mysqldb going otherwise.

Once you've done this, you'll need to set Eclipse to use your homebrew python and run bootstrap.py with the homebrew python.

If you have trouble running PIL, try installing jpeg w/ homebrew:

brew install jpeg

PIP
---

If you want to work with the docs, you should probably PIP install Sphinx locally. I don't include it in the buildout.

Installing gevent
-----------------

pip installing gevent on Mac OS (at least Sierra) fails unless it's invoked thusly:

     `CFLAGS='-std=c99' pip install gevent`

You should probably just do

     `CFLAGS='-std=c99' pip install -r requirements.txt`
